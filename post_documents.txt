of which is still unpublished. The first introduces a new view of
causality, based on Popper's interpretation of quantum theory yet

Preface I am of course not certain whether the two lectures which
I here submit to the patient perusal or the possible refusal of
my readers are, as I hope, the best I have produced so far;
nor is this question, I admit, of any importance. But I wish
to convey to my readers that I have worked hard to make
them the best, since I myself have, in writing them, been
able to learn things of great importance to myself. I am grateful to have been able to do this in my 87th and
88th year, despite the drawbacks of failing memory. A shorter version of the first lecture was given on August
24th, 1988 before the World Congress of Philosophy at
Brighton, under the chairmanship of Professor Richard
Hare. A shorter version of the second lecture was given on
June 9th, 1989 before the Alumni of the School at the
London School of Economics, under the chairmanship of its
Director, Dr I.G. Patel. I never should have been able to write either of these
lectures without the help of my Assistant, Melitta Mew.

A World of Propensities: Two New Views of Causality

Content:
Ladies and Gentlemen, I shall begin with some personal memories and a personal
confession of faith, and only then turn to the topic of my
lecture. It
was 54 years ago, in Prague in August 1934, that I first
attended an International Congress of Philosophy. I found it
uninspiring. But the Congress was preceded by another meeting
in Prague, organized by Otto Neurath, who had kindly invited
me to attend a 'Preliminary Conference' ('Vorkonferenz' as he
called it) which he organized on behalf of the Vienna Circle. I came to Prague with the corrected page proofs of my book,
It

Vienna, and in English 25 years later as The Logic of Scientific
Discovery. In Prague it was read by two Polish philosophers,
Alfred Tarski and Janina Hosiasson-Lindenbaum, the wife of
Tarski's friend and collaborator, Adolf Lindenbaum. Janina
Hosiasson and her husband were murdered when, 5 years later,
the Nazis invaded Poland and systematically exterminated what
they described as its 'Fuhrerschicht': its 'intellectual elite'. Tarski
went from Prague to Vienna where he stayed for a year and
where we became friends. Philosophically, it was the most
important friendship of my life. For I learnt from Tarski the
logical defensibility and the power of absolute and objective
truth: essentially an Aristotelian theory at which, it appears,
Tarski and Godel arrived, independently at almost the same

objective truth - truth as the correspondence of a statement
with the facts - and of absolute truth: if an unambiguously
formulated statement is true in one language, then any correct
translation of it into any other language is also true. This
theory is the great bulwark against relativism and

all fashions. And it allows us to speak of f[a]lsity and its
elimination; of our f[a]llibility; and of the fact that we can learn
from our errors, from our mistakes; and of science as the search
for truth. Moreover, it allows us - indeed, it requires us - to
distinguish clearly between truth and certainty. I vividly
remember, in spite of my bad memory, some of my
conversations in Prague with Alfred Tarski and Janina

conversations in Prague with Alfred Tarski and Janina
Hosiasson and I vividly remember her surprise, if not horror,
at my rejection of probabilistic induction, a field in which she
had been working for several years. She gave me some of her
papers to read, and I found them far better and f[a]r more
responsibly argued than Reichenbach's theory. I decided that
to
I must try attend to her work with the greatest care and,


Content:
I must try attend to her work with the greatest care and,
if possible, find a way of reconciling her results with mine;
or else to see whether her arguments could be used to refute
mine. I soon found that this was not possible: and that a
probabilistic theory of induction would work no better on her
lines than on Reichenbach's. Reichenbach, incidentally, was
also in Prague; but when Carnap tried to introduce me to him
he refused to talk to me or even to shake hands. 

Content:
he refused to talk to me or even to shake hands. Of other
participants I remember, of course, Otto Neurath, Rudolf
Carnap and Philipp Frank, with all of whom I was on very
friendly terms in spite of my opposition to the positivism of
the Circle. Schlick, I believe, came a few days later. I can no
longer remember whether Waismann and Zilsel were present. In the course of the Preliminary Conference, Reichenbach


Content:
In the course of the Preliminary Conference, Reichenbach
read a paper on probabilistic induction and I replied. My reply
was printed with his paper in the journal Erkenntnis; and it
was reprinted 25 years later in the English translation of my
Logik der Forschung (and also in its second German edition)
under the title 'On the so-called "Logic of Induction" and the
"Probability of Hypotheses"'. Carnap was then, and for some years afterwards, entirely
on my side, especially concerning induction (and also


Content:
on my side, especially concerning induction (and also
concerning Reichenbach's personal attitude towards me and
my book); and when my book was published 3 months later, he not only wrote a most favourable review in Erkenntnis,
which he and Reichenbach were editing together, but he
defended himself and me when Reichenbach published in the
same issue a long attack on me and a critical aside against
Carnap's review. Carnap and I had come, in those days, to something like
an agreement on a common research programme on
probability, based on my Logik der Forschung; we agreed to


Content:
probability, based on my Logik der Forschung; we agreed to
distinguish sharply between, on the one hand, probability as
it is used in the probabilistic hypotheses of physics, especially
of quantum theory, which satisfies the mathematical 'calculus
of probabilities', and, on the other hand, the so-called
probability of hypotheses, or their degree of confirmation or
(as I now prefer to call it) their degree of corroboration; and
we agreed not to assume, without strong arguments, that the
degree of confirmation or corroboration of a hypothesis satisfies
to


Content:
to
the calculus of probabilities, but regard this question, in
view of my arguments in Logik, as open -indeed, as the central
problem. This was the state of our discussion reached in 1934 and
1935. But 15 years later Carnap sent me his new big book,
Logical Foundations of Probability, and, opening it, I found
that his explicit starting point in this book was the precise
opposite - the bare, unargued assumption that degree of


Content:
opposite - the bare, unargued assumption that degree of
confirmation is a probability in the sense of the probability
calculus. I felt as a f[a]ther must feel whose son has joined the
Moonies; though, of course, they did not yet exist in those
days. However, I still could comfort myself with the consideration
that Carnap had not given up truth in its objective and absolute
sense, as defended by Tarski. Indeed, he never did. 

Content:
Indeed, he never did. It is this view of truth that gives Godel's important results
their non-relativistic sense. It also gives my results their non­
relativistic sense; despite what many people say.

Content:
Ladies and Gentlemen, please take these remarks as an
expression of my gratitude to Alfred Tarski and as a confession
of faith: of my opposition to relativism and of my 54-year­
long adherence to the Aristotelian theory of truth, rehabilitated
by Tarski and successfully applied by him and by Godel to
some mathematical problems. And I wish to add to this
confession of faith my unshaken conviction that, next to music
and art, science is the greatest, most beautiful and most
enlightening achievement of the human spirit. 

Content:
enlightening achievement of the human spirit. I abhor the
at present so noisy intellectual fashion that tries to denigrate
science, and I greatly admire the marvellous results achieved
in our time by the work of biologists and biochemists and made
available through medicine to sufferers all over our beautiful
earth. Admittedly, science suffers from our human fallibility, like
every other human enterprise. Even if we are doing all we can


Content:
Even if we are doing all we can
to
in order discover our mistakes, our results cannot be certain,
and they may not even be true. But we can learn from our
mistakes: great scientists have shown us how to turn our
fallibility into objectively testable conjectural knowledge. They
are continuing to do so at this moment. All I have said so far has been an attempt to introduce myself


Content:
All I have said so far has been an attempt to introduce myself
to you as a valiant lover of science who has the greatest
admiration for the marvellous and often true results of science
without believing these results to be certain. The results of
science remain hypotheses that may have been well tested, but
not established: not shown to be true. Of course, they may
be true. But even if they fail to be true, they are splendid


Content:
But even if they fail to be true, they are splendid

Content:
And, indeed, they may be true; but new tests may still falsify
them. This method of bold, adventurous theorizing, followed by
exposure to severe testing is the method of life itself as it evolves
to higher forms: it is the method of trials and of the exposure
and elimination of errors through tests. Just as life conquers
new worlds, new lands, the ocean, the air and space, so science
conquers new worlds: new lands, the ocean, the air and space.

All science is cosmology. It is an attempt learn more about
the world. About atoms, about molecules. About living
organisms and about the riddles of the origin of life on earth.
About the origin of thinking, of the human mind; and about

Content:
the ways in which our minds work. These are great tasks; almost impossible tasks. But scientists
have made almost impossible progress in their bold attempts.
I have been most fortunate indeed, throughout my life, to
witness some of these attempts from a distance and others even
from close quarters; and I have sometimes even participated
in the adventure, in the fields of quantum physics and biology. to
I now come my central problem - causality and the change
of our view of the world. 

Content:
of our view of the world. Up to about 1927 physicists, with
few exceptions, believed that the world was a huge and highly
precise clockwork. Descartes, the great French philosopher,
physicist and physiologist, described the clockwork as
mechanical: all causation was push. It was the first, and the
clearest, theory of causation. Later, from about 1900 on, the


Content:
Later, from about 1900 on, the
world was regarded as an electrical clockwork. But in both
cases it was regarded as an ideally precise clockwork. Either
the cog-wheels pushed each other, or the electromagnets
attracted and repelled each other with absolute precision. There
was, in this world, no room for human decisions. Our feelings


Content:
Our feelings
that we are acting, planning, and understanding each other
were illusory. Few philosophers, with the great exception of
Peirce, dared to dispute this deterministic view. But starting with Werner Heisenberg in 1927, a great change

Content:
processes made the clockwork imprecise: there were objective
indeterminacies. Physical theory had to bring in probabilities. It was here that I had some severe disagreement with
Heisenberg and other physicists, even with my hero, Einstein.
For most of them adopted the view that the probabilities had
to do with our lack of knowledge and, therefore, with our state
of mind: they adopted a subjectivist theory of probability. In
opposition to this, I wished to adopt an objectivist theory. 

Content:
opposition to this, I wished to adopt an objectivist theory. This
led me to a cluster of largely mathematical problems; problems
whose allurement remains with me to this very day. The mathematical theory of probability deals with such
things as throwing dice and tossing pennies, or estimating your
expectation of life -perhaps for insurance purposes. How
probable is it that you will live another 20 years? This has its


Content:
This has its
own little mathematical problems. Thus, the probability that
you will live another 20 years from today - that is that you
will still be alive in 2008 -increases for most of you every day
and every week as long as you survive, until it reaches the
probability 1 on the 24th of August 2008. Nevertheless, the
probability that you will survive for another 20 years from any
of the days following today goes down and down with every


Content:
of the days following today goes down and down with every
day and every week you live, with every sneeze and with every
cough; and unless you die by some accident, it is not unlikely
that this probability will become close to O years before your
actual death. Of course, you know that O is the lowest possible
probability and 1 the highest; and that 1 / 2 is the probability
of an event that may happen or, just as easily, not happen,
such as in tossing an unbiased coin where the probability of
'heads turning up' is equal to the probability of 'tails turning


Content:
'heads turning up' is equal to the probability of 'tails turning
up', and each of these events has the probability of 1/2. Mathematical probability theory, as you may know, plays
an important role in quantum physics and, indeed, in all
sciences. I have worked on at least seven different problems
of probability theory since my introduction to the subject at
university. And it was only after decades that I came to satisfactory and very simple solutions. One of these solutions


Content:
One of these solutions
was what I call 'the propensity interpretation of probability'.
I published it first only in 1956, after more than 35 years of
study. This theory has further grown so that it was only in
the last year that I realized its cosmological significance. I mean
the fact that we live in a world of propensities, and that this
fact makes our world both more interesting and more homely
than the world as seen by earlier states of the sciences. 

Content:
than the world as seen by earlier states of the sciences. Now let me explain briefly the propensity interpretation of
probability. For this purpose I will go back to the tossing of
coms. The classical theory of probability erected a powerful system
upon the following definition: 'The probability of an event is
the number of the favourable possibilities divided by the
number of all the equal possibilities.' Thus, the classical theory


Content:
Thus, the classical theory
was about mere possibilities; and the probability of the event
'tails turning up' would be 1 divided by 2 because there are
altogether two equal possibilities and only one is 'favourable'
to the event 'tails'. The other possibility is not favourable to
'tails'. Similarly, the possibility of throwing an even number
smaller than 6 with a perfect die is 2 divided by 6 which, of
course, is the same as 1 / 3. 

Content:
course, is the same as 1 / 3. For there are 6 sides and therefore
6 equal possibilities and only two of these possibilities, that
is the sides marked 2 and 4, are favourable to the event 'an
even number smaller than 6 turning up'. But what happens if the die is loaded or if the penny is
biased? Then, according to the classical theory- say, at the
time of Pascal or at the time of Laplace -we can no longer
say that the six possibilities of the die, or the two possibilities


Content:
say that the six possibilities of the die, or the two possibilities
of the coin, are equal possibilities. Accordingly, since there are
no equal possibilities in such a case, we simply cannot speak
here of probabilities in the classical numerical sense. Of course, Pascal knew that loaded dice had been invented
for cheating at gambling. In fact, everybody knew that if you

Content:
insert in a wooden die a small piece of lead near, say, the face
bearing the number 6, then this number will turn up less
frequently than it does in throws with a fair die, and so the
number on the opposite face will turn up more frequently.
There are still the six possibilites; but they are now not equal
possibilities but loaded or weighted possibilities; possibilities
that may be unequal and whose inequality or different weight
may be assessed, possibilities that may indeed be weighed. It is dear that a more general theory of probability ought
to include such weighted possibilities. 

Content:
to include such weighted possibilities. It is even dear that cases
of equal possibilities could and should be treated as special
cases of weighted possibilities: obviously, equal possibilities
can be regarded as weighted possibilities whose weights happen
to be equal. So the idea of weighted possibilities is fundamental for a It more general theory of probability. is needed even for a more
general theory of gambling, of games of chance. But what is
fa, more important is that it is needed for all the sciences for physics, •for biology, and for such questions as the


Content:
fa, more important is that it is needed for all the sciences for physics, •for biology, and for such questions as the
probability of surviving a certain number of years. These cases
are all very different from and more general than those cases of
gambling with strictly homogeneous and symmetrically built
dice or pennies or roulette wheels. But there is no insuperable difficulty in this generalization:
it is easy to see that in the absence of equal possibilities, we
may still be able to say that certain possibilities and probabilities
are greater, or weightier, than others, as in the case where a


Content:
are greater, or weightier, than others, as in the case where a
die is loaded. The main problem that arises is this: Does there exist a
method - or an instrument like a pair of scales - that can help
us to find out the actual weight of the weighted possibilities?
Does there exist a method that allows us to attribute numerical
values to possibilities that are unequal? The obvious answer is: yes, a statistical method; yes, provided we can, as in the case of dicing, repeat the situation
that produces the probabilistic events in question; or provided
(as in the case of sunshine or rain) the events in question repeat


Content:
(as in the case of sunshine or rain) the events in question repeat
themselves, without our interference. Provided the number of
such repetitions is sufficiently large, we can use statistics as
a method of weighing the possibilities, and of measuring their
weights. Or, to be a little more explicit, the greater or smaller
frequency of occurrences may be used as a test of whether a
hypothetically attributed weight is, indeed, an adequate
hypothesis. 

Content:
hypothesis. To put it more crudely, we take the frequency of
occurrence as measuring the weight of the corresponding
possibility, so that we say that the probability of a rainy Sunday
in June in Brighton equals 1 / 5 if and only if it has been found
over many years that, on average, there will be rain on one
out of five Sundays in June. So we use statistical averages in
order to estimate the various weights of the various possibilities. All this is, I believe, simple and straightforward. 

Content:
All this is, I believe, simple and straightforward. But the
really important points come now.
( 1) If what I have said is true - if we can measure the weight
in
of the possibility of 'two turning up' throwing a certain
loaded die, and find it to be only O .15 instead of = 0 .1666 1 / 6 - then there must be inherent in the
structure of throws with this die ( or with a sufficiently
similar die) a tendency or propensity to realize the event
'two turning up' that is smaller than the tendency shown


Content:
'two turning up' that is smaller than the tendency shown
by a fair die. Thus, my first point is that a tendency or
propensity to realize an event is, in general, inherent in
every possibility and in every single throw, and that we
can estimate the measure of this tendency or propensity
by appealing to the relative frequency of the actual
realization in a large number of throws; in other words
by finding out how often the event in question actually
occurs.


Content:
occurs.
(2) So, instead of speaking of the possibility of an event
occurring, we might speak, more precisely, of an
inherent propensity to produce, upon repetition, a
certain statistical average.

Content:
(3) Now this implies that, upon further repetition-upon
repetition of the repetitions -that the statistics, in their
turn, do show a tendency towards stability, provided
all relevant conditions remain stable.
( 4) Just as we explain the tendency or propensity of a
magnetic needle to turn (from any initial position it may
have assumed) towards the north by (a) its inner
structure, (b) the invisible field of forces carried with
it by our planet, and (c) friction, etc. - in short, by the
invariant aspects of the physical situation; so we explain


Content:
invariant aspects of the physical situation; so we explain
the tendency or propensity of a sequence of throws with
a die to produce (from any starting sequence) stable
statistical frequencies by (a) the inner structure of the
die, (b) the invisible field of forces carried with it by our
planet, and (c) friction, etc. -in short, by the invariant
aspects of the physical situation: the field of propensities
that influences every single throw. The tendency of statistical averages to remain stable if the
conditions remain stable is one of the most remarkable


Content:
conditions remain stable is one of the most remarkable
characteristics of our universe. It can be explained, I hold, only
by the propensity theory; by the theory that there exist weighted
possibilities which are more than mere possibilities, but
tendencies or propensities to become real: tendencies or
propensities to realize themselves which are inherent in all
possibilities in various degrees and which are something like
forces that keep the statistics stable. This is an objective interpretation of the theory of


Content:
This is an objective interpretation of the theory of
probability. Propensities, it is assumed, are not mere
possibilities but are physical realities. They are as real as forces,
or fields of forces. And vice versa: forces are propensities. They
are propensities for setting bodies in motion. Forces are


Content:
Forces are
propensities to accelerate, and fields of forces are propensities
distributed over some region of space and perhaps changing
continuously over this region (like distances from some given
origin). Fields of forces are fields of propensities. They are real,
they exist. Mathematical probabilities are measures that take on
numerical values from O to 1. 0 is usually interpreted as


Content:
numerical values from O to 1. 0 is usually interpreted as
impossibility, 1 as certainty, 1 / 2 as complete indeterminacy,
and values between 1 / 2 and 1 - say 7 / 10 - are interpreted
as 'more probable than not'. Physical propensities may be interpreted somewhat
differently. The propensity 1 is the special case of a classical
force in action: a cause when it produces an effect. If a
propensity is less than 1, then this can be envisaged as the


Content:
propensity is less than 1, then this can be envisaged as the
existence of competing forces pulling in various opposed
directions but not yet producing or controlling a real process.
And whenever the possibilities are discrete rather than
continuous, these forces pull towards distinct possibilities,
where no compromise possibility may exist. And zero
propensities are, simply, no propensities at all, just as the
number zero means 'no number'. (If I tell an author that I have
read a number of his books and have to admit that the number


Content:
read a number of his books and have to admit that the number
is zero, then I was misleading him: I have read none of his
books. Similarly, a propensity zero means no propensity.) For
example, the propensity of getting the number 14 on the next
throw with two ordinary dice is zero: there exists no such
possibility and therefore no propensity. Forces in the modern sense were introduced into physics and
cosmology by Isaac Newton who, of course, had some
predecessors who were feeling their way towards this idea,


Content:
predecessors who were feeling their way towards this idea,
notably Johannes Kepler. The introduction of forces by
Newton was a great success, even though it was opposed by
those who do not like invisible or hidden or 'occult' entities
in physics. Indeed, Bishop Berkeley may be said to have
founded the positivist philosophy of science by attacking
Newton for introducing invisible entities and 'occult qualities'
into nature. 

Content:
into nature. And he was followed in this especially by Ernst
Mach and Heinrich Hertz. But Newton's theory of
forces -especially of attractive forces -had tremendous
explanatory power. And it was further developed and
extended, especially by 0rsted, Faraday and Maxwell, and

Content:
then by Einstein, who tried to explain the Newtonian forces
in their turn by his theory of curved spacetime. The introduction of propensities amounts to generalizing and
extending the idea of forces again. Just as the idea of forces
was opposed by the positivist successors of Berkeley, of Mach,
and of Hertz, so the idea of propensities is again rejected by
some people as introducing into physics what Berkeley had
called 'occult qualities'. Others have accepted my theory of propensities or objective


Content:
Others have accepted my theory of propensities or objective
probabilities, but have (somewhat rashly, I think) tried to
improve upon it. I had stressed that propensities should not
be regarded as properties inherent in an object, such as a die
or a penny, but that they should be regarded as inherent in
a situation ( of which, of course, the object was a part). I asserted
that the situational aspect of the propensity theory was
important, and decisively important for a realist interpretation


Content:
important, and decisively important for a realist interpretation
of quantum theory. But I was criticized by some people who asserted that the
I I
propensities of 1 2 and of 1 6 were intrinsic symmetry
properties of a coin or a die, and that the propensity for
surviving another year, or 20 more years, was an intrinsic
property of the constitution of a man's or a woman's
body and his or her state of health. And, as a strong argument,


Content:
And, as a strong argument,
one of my critics appealed to the survival tables of the life
insurance companies which, admittedly, seem to incorporate
this view. Nevertheless, the view that the propensity to survive is a
property of the state of health and not of the situation can easily
be shown to be a serious mistake. As a matter of course, the
state of health is very important - an important aspect of the
situation. 

Content:
situation. But as anybody may fall ill or become involved in
an accident, the progress of medical science - say, the invention
of powerful new drugs (like antibiotics)- changes the prospects
of everybody to survive, whether or not he or she actually gets into the position of having to take any such drug. The situation
changes the possibilities, and thereby the propensities. I think that this is a perfect counterexample, and that no
more needs to be said. Nevertheless, the example may be a


Content:
Nevertheless, the example may be a
little amplified. The new invention may be expensive, at least
in the beginning, which may make it clear that not only the
intrinsic state of health of a person may count but also the state
of his purse, or else the purse of a possible health service and,
obviously, the quality of its medical men. Incidentally, in my first publication on propensities I pointed
out that the propensity of a penny to fall on a flat table with
heads up is obviously modified if the table top is appropriately


Content:
heads up is obviously modified if the table top is appropriately
slotted. Similarly, one and the same loaded die will have
different propensities if the table top is very elastic rather than
of marble, or if it is covered by a layer of sand. Of course, every experimental physicist knows how much
his results depend on circumstances like temperature or the
presence of moisture. But some typical experiments measure
propensities fairly directly; for example, the Franck-Hertz


Content:
propensities fairly directly; for example, the Franck-Hertz
experiment measures how the propensity of electrons to interact
with gas atoms changes almost discontinuously with the rising
voltage of the electrons. The Franck-Hertz experiment, one of the classic experiments
of quantum theory, studies the dependence of this interaction
on an increasing voltage. As the voltage rises, the intensity of
the current of electrons rises slowly and then, suddenly, falls;
it rises again slowly to a still higher level and falls again


Content:
it rises again slowly to a still higher level and falls again
suddenly. This is interpreted as the result of the single electrons
reaching, step by step, the discrete excitation states of the gas
atoms. Here the change of the voltage - of an external
condition - is the decisive independent variable; and the
changing propensities of the electrons and the atoms to interact
with each other are recorded, as they depend upon the changing
voltage.voltage.

Content:
For this kind of experiment - and many atomic experiments
a calculus of relative or conditional
are of this kind - we need
probabilities a c��culus of a�solute probabilities

as it may suffice for, say, d1cmg experiments or for some
statistical problems (say, life insurance tables). A statement in the absolute calculus may be written p{a) = r

whose changes we may neglect), then we can work with
absolute probabilities or absolute propensities, having once and
for all described the conditions. Thus, if you state that the

in order to create again new possibilities. Our world of
propensities is inherently creative. These tendencies and propensities have led to the emergence
of life. And they have led to the great unfolding of life, to the
evolution of life. And the evolution of life has led to better

And the evolution of life has led to better
conditions for life on earth and thus to new possibilities and

the old forms and from each other. All this means that
possibilities -possibilities that have not yet realized
themselves-have a kind of reality. The numerical propensities
that attach to the possibilities can be interpreted as a measure
of this status of a not yet fully realized reality -a reality in the

realize themselves in time, the open future is, in some way,
already present, with its many competing possibilities, almost
as a promise, as a temptation, as a lure. The future is, in this
way, actively present at every moment. The old world picture that puts before us a mechanism

all in the past - the past kicking us and driving us with kicks
into the future, the past that is gone - is no longer adequate
in our indeterministic world of propensities. Causation is just
a special case of propensity: the case of a propensity equal to
1, a determining demand, or force, for realization. It is not

Content:
attraction, the lure of the future and its competing possibilities, that attract us, that entice us. This is what keeps life - and,
indeed, the world-unfolding. (Remember that Newtonian
forces too are attractive forces!) I now turn to causation. In the light of what has been said
about propensities, two comments will be made on causation;
comments that appear to me new. The first is a comment on the deterministic push theory of
causation. In Plato and Aristotle, movement is something that


Content:
In Plato and Aristotle, movement is something that
needs an explanation: it is explained by a mover. This idea
is clarified and elaborated in Descartes's clockwork theory of
the world. The world is a mechanical clockwork in which a
cog of one cog-wheel pushes the adjacent cog of the adjacent
cog-wheel. Since the wheels are perfect, there is no loss of
movement. 

Content:
movement. The first mover is the first cause, and all causation
is push. Newton was still thinking on these lines and therefore
made an attempt, as he hints in the Optics, to reduce the
attractive pull to push. But in contrast to Lesage, he realized
that a theory of the Lesage type would not work. So Descartes's
monistic push theory of causation gave way to a push-me-pull­

0rsted forces play a most important additional role. But these
0rsted forces are not central and therefore they really destroy

becomes now abstract: 0rsted forces make a field theory
inevitable. And so the new physics was called 'theoretical

the Helmholtz circle. It tried to describe the abstract, the
hidden, the invariant structural properties of the physical
world.

world. Cause became that state of affairs which, relative to
an accepted theory, was described by the initial conditions.
Effect was that event or that state of affairs which the theory,
in the presence of the initial conditions, would predict.

Content:
Owing to this deductive relationship, it is trivial that, in the
presence of the theory, the probability of the effect given the
cause equals 1: p (effect, cause) = l This, I say, is trivial. But it leads in our world of propensities
to the following view. What may happen in the future - say,
tomorrow at noon - is, to some extent, open. There are many
possibilities trying to realize themselves, but few of them have
a very high propensity, given the existing conditions. 

Content:
a very high propensity, given the existing conditions. When
tomorrow noon approaches, under constantly changing
conditions, many of these propensities will have become zero
and others very small; and some of the propensities that remain
will have increased. At noon, those propensities that realize
themselves will be equal to 1 in the presence of the then existing
conditions. Some will have moved to 1 continuously; others


Content:
Some will have moved to 1 continuously; others
will have moved to 1 in a discontinuous jump. (One can
therefore still distinguish between prima f acie causal and
acausal cases.) And although we may regard the ultimate state
of the conditions at noon as the cause of the ultimate realization
of the propensities, there is nothing of the old Cartesian
deterministic push left in this view of the world. This is my first comment on causation in the light of the
theory of propensities. But to complement the first, a second


Content:
But to complement the first, a second
comment is needed. In our theoretical physics, that is in our somewhat abstract
description of the invariant structural properties of our world,
there are what we may call natural laws of a deterministic
character and others that we may call natural laws of a
probabilistic character, like those described by Franck and
Hertz. Let us first look at the deterministic laws - say, Kepler's
laws, since they are still valid in Einstein's theory for not too


Content:
laws, since they are still valid in Einstein's theory for not too
excentric planetary ellipses; or, say, Bohr's wonderful 1921
theory of the periodic system. What is the status of this kind of theory that describes the
structural properties of our world? They are hypotheses, arrived at in (often unsuccessful)
attempts to solve some problems such as Kepler's great problem
to find the secrets of the 'Harmony of the Universe', or Bohr's
problem of explaining the periodic system of elements in terms
of his theory of the electrons surrounding the Rutherford


Content:
of his theory of the electrons surrounding the Rutherford
nuclei. That they were wonderful hypotheses, I wish to stress,
in full admiration of the great achievement of these masters.
Yet that they were not more than hypotheses we know from
the fact that Kepler's laws were corrected by Newton and Ein­
stein, and that Bohr's theory was corrected by the theory of
isotopes. Being hypotheses, these theories had to be tested. And it was

And it was
the close agreements with the tests that gave them their great
importance. Now, how are such theories tested? Obviously by making
experiments. And this means: by creating, at will, artificial
conditions that either exclude, or reduce to zero, all the
interfering and disturbing propensities. Only the system of our planets is so well isolated from all


Content:
Only the system of our planets is so well isolated from all
extraneous mechanical interference that it is a unique, natural
laboratory experiment. Here, only the internal disturbances
interfere with the precision of Kepler's laws. Kepler knew
nothing of these problems, for example of the insolubility of
the three-body problem, and it was one of the glories of
Newton's theory that he invented an approximation method
of solving them. 

Content:
of solving them. He tamed, up to a point, the disturbing
propensities of the planets for interfering with each other. In most laboratory experiments we have to exclude many
disturbing extraneous influences such as changes of temperature
or the normal moisture of the air. Or we may have to create

Content:
an artificial environment of extreme temperatures - say, near
to absolute zero. In this we are led entirely by our hypothetical
insight into the theoretical structure of our world. And we have
to learn from our experimental mistakes that lead to
unsatisfactory results: results are satisfactory only if they can
be repeated at will; and this happens only if we have learnt
how to exclude the interfering propensities. But what does all this show us? 

Content:
But what does all this show us? It shows that in the non­
laboratory world, with the exception of our planetary system,
no such strictly deterministic laws can be found. Admittedly,
in certain cases such as the planetary movements, we can
interpret events as due to the vectorial sum of forces that our
theories have isolated. But in any actual event such as, say,
the fall of an apple from a tree, this is not the case. 

Content:
the fall of an apple from a tree, this is not the case. Real apples
are emphatically not Newtonian apples. They fall usually when
the wind blows. And the whole process is initiated by a
biochemical process that weakens the stem so that the often­
repeated movement due to the wind, together with the
Newtonian weight of the apple, leads to a snap of the stem- a
process that we can analyse but cannot calculate in detail,


Content:
process that we can analyse but cannot calculate in detail,
mainly because of the probabilistic character of the biochemical
processes that prevents us from predicting what will happen
in a unique situation. What we might be able to calculate is
the propensity of a special type of apple to fall within, say,
the next hour. This may make it possible for us to predict that,
if the weather deteriorates, it will very probably fall within
the next week. 

Content:
the next week. There is no determinism in Newton's falling
apple if we look at it realistically. And much less in many of
our changing states of mind, for example in our so-called
motives. Our inclination to think deterministically derives from
our acts as movers, as pushers of bodies: from our

ideology. All this is now supported by the new results of the
mathematics of dynamic (or deterministic) chaos. This new theory has shown that, even on the assumption
of a classical (or 'deterministic') system of mechanics, we may
obtain, from some special but quite simple initial conditions,
motions that are 'chaotic', in the sense that they quickly become
completely unpredictable. 

Content:
completely unpredictable. As a consequence, we can now easily
explain such facts within classical 'deterministic' physics as the
molecular chaos of every gas. We neither need to assume them,
nor do we need to call upon quantum physics for their
derivation. This argument seems to me valid. But an interpretation that

we may - or that we should - assume that our world is in
reality deterministic, even where it appears to be indeterministic
or chaotic; that behind an indeterministic appearance, there
lies hidden a deterministic reality. This interpretation I regard
as a mistake. For what has been established is that classical
physics is only seemingly ( or prima facie) deterministic; that


Content:
physics is only seemingly ( or prima facie) deterministic; that
its determinism fits only problems of a special kind, such as
the Newtonian two-body problem, while it turns out to be
indeterministic if problems of a wider range are taken into
consideration. (This view I have upheld at least since 1950;
compare my paper 'Indeterminism in Quantum Physics and
in Classical Physics' (BJPS 1950) and my book, The Open
Universe (1982) with an interpretation of some important
results by Hadamard.) To sum up, neither our physical world nor our physical
theories are deterministic, even though of course many


Content:
theories are deterministic, even though of course many
possibilities are excluded by the laws of nature and of
probability: there are many zero propensities. And even non­
zero propensities that are very small will not realize themselves
if the situation changes before they had a chance. The fact that
conditions are never quite constant may, indeed, explain why
certain very low propensities seem never to realize themselves.

that in the evolution of life there were almost infinite
possibilities. But they were largely exclusive possibilities; so
most steps were exclusive choices, destroying many
possibilities. As a consequence, only comparatively few
propensities could realize themselves. Still, the variety of those
that have realized themselves is staggering. I believe that this
was a process in which both accidents and preferences,
preferences of the organisms for certain possibilities, were
mixed: the organisms were in search of a better world. Here
the preferred possibilities were, indeed, allurements. Looking at my own long life, I find that the main allurements
which led me on and on from my 17th year were theoretical
problems. And among these the problems of science and of
probability theory loomed large. These were preferences. The
solutions were accidents. A brief closing passage from the preface to a book of mine
may apply all this to the education of young scientists.
I think that there is only one way to science - or to
philosophy, for that matter: to meet a problem, to see its
beauty and fall in love with it; to get married to it and to
live with it happily, till death do ye part - unless you should
meet another and even more fascinating problem or unless,
indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do
obtain a solution, you may then discover, to your delight,
the existence of a whole family of enchanting, though
perhaps difficult, problem children, for whose welfare you
may work, with a purpose, to the end of your days. Towards an Evolutionary Theory of Knowledge

occasion to which I have been looking forward eagerly for
the last 40 years. My second request to you, dear Dr Patel, is to allow me
to change the wording of the title of this address. When I
was urged by the School to produce a title, I had little time
to think. I now feel that 'Evolutionary Epistemology'
sounds pretentious, especially since there exists a less
pretentious equivalent. So, please let me change my title to
its equivalent and let me call this Inaugural Address
'Towards an Evolutionary Theory of Knowledge'. It
is my aim, and my problem, at this Inaugural to interest
you in work done and, even more, in work yet to be done
in the theory of knowledge, by placing it in the wide and
exciting context of biological evolution, and to show you
that we can learn something new from such an exercise.

Content:
I do not start by asking a question such as 'What is
knowledge?' and, even less, 'What does "knowledge"
mean?'. Instead, my starting point is a very simple proposi­
tion - indeed, an almost trivial one - the proposition that
animals can know something: that they can have knowl­
edge. For example, a dog may know that his master returns
home, on working days, at about 6 p.m., and the behaviour
of the dog may give many indications, clear to his friends,


Content:
of the dog may give many indications, clear to his friends,
that he expects the return of his master at that time. I shall
show that, in spite of its triviality, the proposition that
animals can know something completely revolutionizes the
theory of knowledge as it is still widely taught. There are, of course, some people who would deny my
trivial proposition. They might say, perhaps, that in attribu­
ting knowledge to the dog I am merely using a metaphor,


Content:
ting knowledge to the dog I am merely using a metaphor,
and a blatant anthropomorphism. Even biologists interested
in the theory of evolution have said such things. My reply
is: yes, it is a blatant anthropomorphism, but it is not merely
a metaphor. And the anthropomorphism is a very useful
one: one that is indispensable in any theory of evolution. If


Content:
If
you speak of the nose of the dog, or of his legs, then these
are also anthropomorphisms, even though we take for
granted that it is simply true that the dog has a nose - if
somewhat different from our human nose. Now, if you are interested in the theory of evolution, you
will find that part of it is the important theory of homology,
and that the dog's nose and my nose are homologous, which
means that they are both inherited from a distant common
ancestor. 

Content:
ancestor. Without this hypothetical theory of homology,
evolutionary theory could not exist. Obviously, the theory
of homology is a highly speculative and very successful
hypothesis, and one that all evolutionists adopt. My attribu­
tion of knowledge to the dog is therefore an anthropo­
morphism, but it is not just a metaphor. Rather, it implies


Content:
Rather, it implies
the hypothesis that some organ of the dog, in this case pre­
sumably the brain, has a function that corresponds not only in some vague sense to the biological function of human
knowledge, but is homologous with it. Please note that the things that may be homologous are,
in the original sense, organs. But they may also be functions
of organs. And they may also be procedures. Even behav­


Content:
Even behav­
iour may be hypothesized to be homologous in the evolu­
tionary sense; for example, courtship behaviour, especially
ritualized courtship behaviour. That this is indeed homo­
logous in the hereditary or genetic sense between, say, dif­
ferent but closely related species of birds, is very convinc­
ing. That it is homologous between ourselves and some
species of fish seems highly dubious, yet it remains a serious


Content:
species of fish seems highly dubious, yet it remains a serious
hypothesis. Of course, the possession of a mouth or of a
brain in fish is most convincingly homologous with our
possession of the corresponding organs: it is quite convinc­
ing that they are genetically derived from the organs of a
common ancestor. I hope the central importance of the theory of homology
for the theory of evolution has become sufficiently clear for
my purpose; that is, for defending the existence of animal


Content:
my purpose; that is, for defending the existence of animal
knowledge, not as a mere metaphor, but as a serious evolu­
tionary hypothesis. This hypothesis does in no way imply that animals will be
aware of their knowledge; and it thereby draws attention to
the fact that we ourselves possess knowledge of which we
are not aware, not conscious. Our own unconscious knowledge has often the character
of unconscious expectations, and sometimes we may become
conscious of having had an expectation of this kind when it


Content:
conscious of having had an expectation of this kind when it
turns out to have been mistaken. An example of this is an experience that I had several
times in my long career: in going down some stairs and
reaching the last step, I almost fell, and became aware of the

Content:
fact that I had unconsciously expected that there was one
more step, or one less step, than actually existed. This led me to the following formulation: when we are
surprised by some happening, the surprise is usually due to
an unconscious expectation that something else would
happen. 5. We therefore must clearly distinguish between the
truth of an expectation or a hypothesis and its certainty; and
therefore between two ideas: the idea of truth and the idea
of certainty; or, as we may also say, between truth and


Content:
of certainty; or, as we may also say, between truth and
certain truth - for example, a mathematically demonstrable
truth. 6. There is much truth in much of our knowledge, but
little certainty. We must approach our hypotheses critically;
we must test them as severely as we can, in order to find out
whether they cannot be shown to be false after all. I shall now try to give you a list of 19 interesting conclu­
sions that we can draw, and partly have drawn (although so

sions that we can draw, and partly have drawn (although so
far unconsciously) from our trivial proposition that animals
can know something. Knowledge has often the character of expectations. 2. Expectations have usually the character of hy­
potheses, of conjectural or hypothetical knowledge: they are
uncertain. And those who expect, or who know, may be
quite unaware of this uncertainty. In the example of the dog,


Content:
In the example of the dog,
the dog may die without ever having been disappointed in
this expectation of his master's timely return: but we know
that the timely return was never certain, and that the dog's
expectation was a very risky hypothesis. (After all, there
might have been a railway strike.) So we can say: Before proceeding with this list to the next point ( to point
9.), I wish to digress for a moment. For I want to say a few
words against the widespread doctrine of sociological
relativism, often unconsciously held, especially by sociol­

relativism, often unconsciously held, especially by sociol­
ogists who study the ways of scientists and who think that
they thereby study science and scientific knowledge. Many
of these sociologists do not believe in objective truth, but

what the experts believe to be true - or, at least, the great
majority of the experts.

majority of the experts. But in all sciences, the experts are
sometimes mistaken. Whenever there is a breakthrough,
a really important new discovery, this means that the
experts have been proved wrong, and that the facts, the

they are seldom well-founded. Strong feelings of conviction
make dogmatists of us. They may even turn us into hysteri­

which they unconsciously know is not available. 3. Most kinds of knowledge, whether of men or

truth for at least 2,500 years. But let us now return to our evolutionary theory of
knowledge, to our trivial starting proposition that animals
can know something, and to our list of results obtained
from, or suggested by, this trivial proposition. 9. Can only animals know? Why not plants? Obviously,
in the biological and evolutionary sense in which I speak of
knowledge, not only animals and men have expectations


Content:
knowledge, not only animals and men have expectations
and therefore (unconscious) knowledge, but also plants;
and, indeed, all organisms. 10. Trees know that they may find much-needed water
by pushing their roots into deeper layers of the earth; and
they know ( or the tall ones do) how to grow up vertically.
Flowering plants know that warmer days are about to
arrive, and they know how and when to open their flowers,
and to close them - according to sensed changes in radiation
intensity or in temperature. 

Content:
intensity or in temperature. Thus they have something like
sensations or perceptions to which they respond, and
something like sense organs. And they know, for example,
how to attract bees and other insects. 11. An apple tree that sheds its fruit or its leaves offers
a beautiful example for one of the central points of our
investigations. The tree is adapted to the seasonal changes of


Content:
The tree is adapted to the seasonal changes of
the year. Its structure of inbuilt biochemical processes keeps
them in step with these law-like and long-term environmental
changes. It expects these changes: it is attuned to them, it has
foreknowledge of them. (Trees, especially tall trees, are also
finely adjusted to such invariants as gravitational forces.) But
the tree responds, in an appropriate and well-adapted
manner, also to short-term changes and forces, and even to

manner, also to short-term changes and forces, and even to
momentary events in the environment. Chemical changes in
the stems of the apples and of the leaves prepare them for fall­
ing; but they usually fall in response to the momentary pull
of the wind: the ability to respond appropriately to short­
term or even momentary events or changes in the environ­
ment is closely analogous to the ability of an antmal to
respond to short-term perceptions, to sense experiences. 12. The distinction between adaptation to, or

the changing seasons, on the one side, and adaptation to, or
knowledge of, environmental short-term changes and
events, on the other side, is of the greatest interest. While
short-term events occur in the life of the individual
organisms, the long-term and law-like environmental con­
ditions are such that adaptation to them must have been at
work throughout the evolution of countless generations.
And if we look more closely at short-term adaptation, at the
knowledge of, and the response to, environmental short­


Content:
knowledge of, and the response to, environmental short­
term events, then we see that the ability of the individual
organism to respond appropriately to short-term events
(such as a particular pull of the wind or, in the animal
kingdom, the appearance of a foe) is also a long-term adap­
tation, and also the work of adaptation going on through
countless generations. A grazing flock of wild geese is approached by a
fox. One of them sees the fox and gives the alarm. 

Content:
One of them sees the fox and gives the alarm. It is
precisely a situation like this - a short-term event - in which
the eyes of an animal can save its life. The animal's ability
to respond appropriately depends on its possession of eyes
of sense organs - adapted to an environment in which
daylight is periodically available (analogous to the change of
the seasons or of the constant availability of the directional
pull of gravity, used by the tree to find the direction of its


Content:
pull of gravity, used by the tree to find the direction of its
growth); in which deadly foes are threatening (that is, in
which crucially significant objects exist for visual identifica­
tion); and in which escape is possible if these foes are iden­
tified at a sufficient distance.
All this adaptation is of the nature of long-term
knowledge about the environment. And a little thinking will
make it clear that without this kind of adaptation, without
this kind of knowledge of law-like regularities, sense organs


Content:
this kind of knowledge of law-like regularities, sense organs
like the eyes would be useless. Thus we must conclude that
the eyes could never have evolved without an unconscious
and very rich knowledge about long-term environmental
conditions. This knowledge, no doubt, evolved together with the eyes and with their use. Yet at every step it must
have somehow preceded the evolution of the sense organ,
and of its use. 

Content:
and of its use. For the knowledge of the pre-conditions of its
use are built into the organ. Philosophers and even scientists often assume that
all our knowledge stems from our senses, the 'sense data'
which our senses deliver to us. They believe (as did, for
example, the famous theorist of knowledge, Rudolf Carnap)
that the question 'How do you know?' is in every case
equivalent to the question 'What are the observations that


Content:
equivalent to the question 'What are the observations that
entitle you to your assertion?'. But seen from a biological
point of view, this kind of approach is a colossal mistake.
For our senses to tell us anything, we must have prior
knowledge. In order to be able to see a thing, we must know
what 'things' are: that they can be located within some
space; that some of them can move while others cannot; that
some of them are of immediate importance to us, and there­


Content:
some of them are of immediate importance to us, and there­
fore are noticeable and will be noticed, while others, less
important, will never penetrate into our consciousness: they
may not even be unconsciously noticed, but they may simply
leave no trace whatever upon our biological apparatus. For
this apparatus is highly active and selective, and it actively
selects only what is at the moment of biological importance.
But in order to do so, it must be able to use adaptation,
expectation: prior knowledge of the situation must be


Content:
expectation: prior knowledge of the situation must be
available, including its possibly significant elements. This
prior knowledge cannot, in turn, be the result of observa­
tion; it must, rather, be the result of an evolution by trial
and error. Thus the eye itself is not the result of observation,
but the result of evolution by trial and error, of adaptation,
of non-observational long-term knowledge. And it is the


Content:
And it is the
result of such knowledge, derived not from short-term
observation, but from adaptation to the environment and to
such situations as constitute the problems to be solved in the
task of living; situations that make our organs, among them
our sense organs, significant instruments in the moment-by­
moment task of living.

16. I hope I have been able to give you some idea of the
importance of the distinction between long-term and short­
term adaptation, long-term and short-term knowledge, and
of the fundamental character of the long-term knowledge: of
the fact that it must always precede short-term or observa­
tional knowledge, and of the impossibility that long-term
knowledge can be obtained from short-term knowledge
alone. Also, I hope that I have been able to show you that

Also, I hope that I have been able to show you that
both kinds of knowledge are hypothetical: both are conjec­
tural knowledge, although in a different way. (Our knowl­
edge, or a tree's knowledge, of gravity will turn out to be
gravely mistaken if we, or the tree, are placed in a no-longer
accelerated rocket or ballistic missile.) Long-term conditions
(and the knowledge of them) may be subject to revision; and
an instance of short-term knowledge may turn out to be a
misinterpretation. And so we come to the decisive and perhaps most general

And so we come to the decisive and perhaps most general
proposition, valid for all organisms including man, even
though it may perhaps not cover all forms of human knowl­
edge. 17. All adaptations to environmental and to internal
regularities, to long-term situations and to short-term
situations, are kinds of knowledge - kinds of knowledge
whose great importance we can learn from evolutionary
biology. There are, perhaps, some forms of human knowl­

There are, perhaps, some forms of human knowl­

or of attempted adaptations. But, roughly speaking, almost
all forms of knowledge of an organism, from the unicellular
amoeba to Albert Einstein, serve the organism to adapt
itself to its actual tasks, or to tasks that may turn up in the
future. 18. Life can only exist, and can only survive, if it is in

ago. (Unicellular life came into existence not much later.)
This happened soon after the earth cooled down sufficiently
to allow some of the water in its atmosphere to liquify. Until

then, water had existed only in the form of steam or clouds,

may be said to coincide with the origin and the evolution of
life, and to be closely linked with the origin and evolution
of our planet earth. Evolutionary theory links knowledge,
and with it ourselves, with the cosmos; and so the problem
of knowledge becomes a problem of cosmology.

drawn from the proposition that animals can have know­

of Scientific Discovery, first published in German in 1934,
and published in English for the first time 25 years later, in
1959. In the Preface to the first English edition I wrote of
the fascination of the problem of cosmology; and I said of

place on earth that were favourable to the origin and to the
evolution of life.

over the earth. But those originally so very favourable local
conditions could hardly have prevailed over many different
geographical regions; so it seems th at life must have had a

bacterial forms evolved that were adapted to very different
environmental conditions. Such, it appears, are the facts. Of course, they are far
from certain: they are hypothetical interpretations of some
geological findings. But if they are even approximately
correct, they refute, for two reasons, the at present most
widely accepted theory of the origin of life: the so-called
'soup theory' or 'broth theory'. 

Content:
'soup theory' or 'broth theory'. First reason: as the leading defenders of the soup theory
assert, this theory demands a low temperature for the soup
or broth in which the macromolecules develop, and later
join up to form the first organism. The reason for their
assertion is that, if the temperature is not very low (the
broth must be considerably supercooled below 0 [°]C), the
macromolecules quickly decompose, instead of joining up. But what we know of the earth in those days indicates


Content:
But what we know of the earth in those days indicates
that no such cool places existed. The surface of the earth,
and even more the seas, were much hotter than today; and
even today a watering place supercooled below 0 [°]C would
not easily be available, except perhaps near the North Pole
or within a refrigerating plant. Second reason: the theory that the macromolecules in the
soup have joined up, and so have organized themselves into
a living organism, is improbable in the extreme. 

Content:
a living organism, is improbable in the extreme. The
improbability is so great that one would have to assume an
extremely long time-span in order to make the event a little
less improbable; a time-span far longer, indeed, than the
calculated time for which the cosmos has existed. So say
even some of the most prominent defenders of the soup
theory. This constitutes a sound refutation of the theory in ques­

This constitutes a sound refutation of the theory in ques­

formation of (boiling hot) liquid water and the origin of life is surprisingly short, and far too short to allow for an event
of such extreme improbability to happen - even if the high
temperature were acceptable to the soup theorists. These two reasons constitute two refutations of the at
present ruling soup theory of the origin of life. (There are

theory - one that is of still greater relevance to the evolu­
tionary theory of knowledge and to the problems we are
discussing here. He has produced a biochemical theory of
the origin of the first light-sensitive organ; that is, of the
earliest evolutionary predecessor of our eyes. Since our eyes
are our most important sense organs, this result is of great
interest to our discussion.

Content:
The main result is this. It is known that some early uni­
cellular micro-organism, presumably a bacterium, invented
a revolutionary electro-chemical method of transforming
sunlight into chemical energy: a method of using sunlight
as a food, a method of feeding on sunlight. It was a bold
and, indeed, a dangerous invention since, as we all know,
too much sunlight - and especially the ultraviolet portion
of sunlight - can kill. 

Content:
of sunlight - can kill. So with this invention, several
problems arose for the cell (that previously may have been
living deep down in the dark sea). They were pointed out
by Wachtershauser. The first problem was to find out where sunlight is and,
by using this information, to move towards it. This problem
was solved by the first formation of a sense organ with the

was solved by the first formation of a sense organ with the
function of our eyes, a sense organ chemically linked to
some already existing executive mechanism for the move­
ment of the cell. A second problem that arose was that of avoiding the
danger of getting too much ultraviolet sunlight: of moving
away in time, before suffering damage, towards some shade,
presumably towards a deeper layer of sea water. Thus in the evolution of the eye, even its earliest
predecessor had to become a controller of the movement of

predecessor had to become a controller of the movement of
the cell. It had to become part of the feeding mechanism of
the cell, and part of its security movements: its mechanism
for evading danger. The eye helped to avoid radiation
damage to the cell - to anticipate danger. Even its very first
function assumed prior knowledge of environmental states
and possibilities.

and possibilities. Wachtershauser pointed out that the revolutionary inven­
tion of feeding on sunlight would have been self-destructive
without that other, that essentially protective invention of
moving out of sunlight (and presumably also into it) becom­
ing part of the invention of the early eye and its link to the apparatus of motion. And so the problem arises in his theory:
how could these two great inventions come together? If we take an interest in biological evolution, especially in
early evolution, then we must be constantly aware of the

early evolution, then we must be constantly aware of the
fact that life is, basically, a chemical process. It was
Heraclitus, half a millenium before the birth of Christ, who
said that life was a process, like fire; and, indeed, our life
is something like a complex process of chemical oxidation.
In the earliest stages of its evolution, when free oxygen was
not available, sulphur played its role instead. As you may
know, it was the bacterial invention of using sunlight as

know, it was the bacterial invention of using sunlight as
food - which, incidentally, led later to the self-invention of
the kingdom of plants - that produced the greatest of all
life-induced revolutions in the history of our environment: it
introduced oxygen into the atmosphere. And so it created
the air that we know, that makes our life possible, life as we
know it: our breathing, our lungs, our fire (within and
without). Heraclitus was right: we are not things, but

Heraclitus was right: we are not things, but
flames. Or a little more prosaically, we are, like all cells,
processes of metabolism; nets of chemical processes, of
highly active (energy-coupled) chemical pathways. The great Belgian biochemist Marcel Florkin (1900-
1979) was one of the first to see clearly that the evolution
of life, or organisms, is an evolution of nets of chemical
pathways. The net of pathways that constitutes a cell at

The net of pathways that constitutes a cell at
some given period of time may make it possible for some
new pathway, often just a slight variation, to graft itself
upon the then extant system. The new pathway may have
been impossible without some of the chemical compounds
produced by the old system of pathways. As Florkin pointed
out, the net of chemical pathways of an extant cell often still
retains, as part of this net, the archaic pathways of some

retains, as part of this net, the archaic pathways of some
billion years ago that made the later graftings possible. This,
as Florkin pointed out, is analogous to the way in which
anatomic pathways of the anatomic construction of the

ancestors of, say, some hundred million years ago. Thus the
extant pathways of the metabolism may reveal some of its
evolutionary history; a situation analogous to the so-called
'biogenetic law' of Fritz Muller and Ernst Haeckel. It is within this setting of Florkin's ideas that Wachters­
hauser was able to explain the riddle of the coincidence of the
two great inventions: the invention of feeding on sunlight and
the invention of light-sensitivity, of the archaic eye. The


Content:
The
explanation is that both inventions are chemically very
closely related: one of the pathways producing the machinery
for feeding on sunlight and the pathway for producing the
visual apparatus are structurally connected. We may speculate that the invention resulted from the
general tendency of organisms to explore their environment;
in this case, by rising towards the surface layer of the sea.
Presumably, the one or the other of these bacteria had,
accidentally, evolved to a stage that made it possible to invent

accidentally, evolved to a stage that made it possible to invent
both of these new, chemically connected, grafts. Other
organisms will also have boldly ventured near the surface,
only to be destroyed by sunlight. But one (or perhaps a few)
had the right chemical outfit, and survived. It was able to
turn the surface layer of the sea into the richest feeding
ground for its offspring; and its offspring exuded those huge


Content:
ground for its offspring; and its offspring exuded those huge
amounts of oxygen that transformed the atmosphere. We see that the Darwinian trial-and-error method turns
out to be a method of the (partly accidental) variation and
accretion of chemical pathways. In extant cells the pathways
are controlled, step by chemical step, by enzymes which are
highly specific chemical catalysts, that is, chemical means of
speeding up specific chemical steps; and the enzymes are
partly controlled by the genes. 

Content:
partly controlled by the genes. But a genetic mutation, and
the synthesis of a new enzyme, will not lead to a new step
in the net of pathways unless the new enzyme accidentally
fits into the extant net; it is always the existing structure of
the net of pathways that determines what new variations or accretions are possible. It is the existing net that contains the
potentiality for new inventions; and a fitting enzyme, if not
yet available, may become available soon. In some cases it

In some cases it
may decide the future evolution of the species by determining
which of the potential steps will be realized. (One step may
lead to a slow evolution while another step may lead to a
cascade of further steps. Both steps will be equally Darwin­
ian, since they are subject to selection; their apparently
different speeds are likely to be explicable in chemical terms.) I will now try to list some of the lessons to be learned for
the theory of knowledge from all that has been said so far. The main lesson to be drawn may be formulated, perhaps


Content:
The main lesson to be drawn may be formulated, perhaps
with some little exaggeration, as follows. Even in the most
primitive organisms, and even in the most primitive cases of
sensitivity, everything depends upon the organism itself:
upon its structure, its state, its activity. More especially, even
if we confine our discussion for the moment to the problem
of obtaining some knowledge from the environment with the
help of the organism's sensitivity to the momentary state of


Content:
help of the organism's sensitivity to the momentary state of
its environment, even then everything will depend on the
organism's own state, its long-term structure, its state of
preparation for solving its problems, its state of activity. In order to develop more fully what I have just said only
very roughly, it is useful to introduce here a variant of the
Kantian terminology of a priori and a posteriori. In Kant,
knowledge a priori means knowledge that we possess prior
to sense-observation; and knowledge a posteriori means


Content:
to sense-observation; and knowledge a posteriori means
knowledge we possess posterior to sense-observation, or
after observation; and I will use the terms 'a priori' and 'a
posteriori' only in this temporal or historical sense. (Kant
himself uses his term [a ] priori to mean, in addition,
knowledge that is not [mer]ely prior to observation but also
'a priori valid'; by which he means necessarily or certainly
true. Of course, I shall not follow him in this since I am
stressing the uncertain and conjectural character of our

Content:
knowledge.) So I shall use the term 'a priori' to characterize
that kind of knowledge - of fallible or conjectural knowl­
edge - which an organism has prior to sense experience;
roughly speaking, it is inborn knowledge. And I shall use the
term 'a posteriori' for knowledge that is obtained with the
help of the sensitivity of the organism to momentary changes
in the state of its environment. Using this Kantian terminology with the modifications I
have just indicated, we can now say that Kant's own posi­


Content:
have just indicated, we can now say that Kant's own posi­
tion - highly revolutionary at the time - is this. (A) Most knowledge of detail, of the momentary state
of our surroundings, is a posteriori. (B) But such a posteriori knowledge is impossible with­
out a priori knowledge that we somehow must possess before
we can acquire observational or a posteriori knowledge:
without it, what our senses tell us can make no sense. We
must establish an overall frame of reference, or else there will
be no context available to make sense of our sensations. (C)
This a priori knowledge contains, especially, knowl­

This a priori knowledge contains, especially, knowl­
edge of the structure of space and time ( of space and time
relations), and of causality (of causal relations). I think that, in all these points, Kant is right. (Incident­
ally, I also think that he had Hardly a real successor in this
except perhaps Schopenhauer.) In my opinion, Kant antici­
pated the most important results of the evolutionary theory
of knowledge. But I am going much further than Kant. I think that, say,


Content:
I think that, say,
99 per cent of the knowledge of all organisms is inborn and
incorporated in our biochemical constitution. And I think
that 99 per cent of the knowledge taken by Kant to be a
posteriori and to be 'data' that are 'given' to us through our
senses is, in fact, not a posteriori, but a priori. For our senses can serve us (as Kant himself saw) only with yes-and­
no answers to our own questions; questions that we
conceive, and ask, a priori; and questions that sometimes


Content:
conceive, and ask, a priori; and questions that sometimes
are very elaborate. Moreover, even the yes-and-no answers
of the senses have to be interpreted by us - interpreted in the
light of our a priori preconceived ideas. And, of course, they
are often misinterpreted. Thus, all our knowledge is hypothetical. It is an adapta­
tion to a partly unknown environment.

tion to a partly unknown environment. It is often successful
and often unsuccessful, the result of anticipatory trials and
of unavoidable errors, and of error elimination. Some of the
errors that have entered the inheritable constitution of an
organism are eliminated by eliminating their bearer; that is,
the individual organism. But some errors escape, and this is
one reason why we are all fallible: our adaptation to the

one reason why we are all fallible: our adaptation to the
environment is never optimal, and it is always imperfect. A
frog is constituted a priori so that it can see its prey - a fly - only when the fly moves. When the fly sits still, the frog
cannot see it, even if it is very close: the frog's adaptation is
imperfect. Organisms and their organs incorporate expectations
about their environment; and expectations - as we have seen - are homologous with our theories: as homologous as is the
nose of my dog with my nose. 

Content:
nose of my dog with my nose. So I suggest the hypothesis
that adaptations and expectations are homologous even with
scientific theories (and vice versa theories with adaptations
and expectations). Theories may often contain evaluations.
A unicellular organism's sensitivity to light, to heat, and to
acidity may help it to escape from too little or too much of
any of these. The organism's structure may incorporate the

The organism's structure may incorporate the
theory: 'the surrounding water can be dangerous: it may be
too hot or too cold, and it may be too much or too little
acid.' Clearly, such evaluations can evolve only if the
organism is able to take action; for example, by moving
away if it anticipates danger from these environmental
states. Problems, values, and activity all evolve together.

Content:
I have said something about the origin of the archaic eye;
and we can now say that its invention incorporates new
discoveries, new theories, new knowledge about the
environment and also the possibility of new values. For the
first bacterium that not only achieved the new chemical
synthesis, but went with it to a layer near the surface of the
sea and survived, after millions of its brothers had
succumbed, proved by its survival that it had solved a
problem of adaptation; and in solving a problem, it

problem of adaptation; and in solving a problem, it
introduced a new theory about new values. The invention
was incorporated in the structure of the organism; in new,
inheritable knowledge and therefore in new a priori
knowledge. Within this great revolution, the momentary signals
conveyed by the eye to the organism were as such compara­
tively unimportant. They became important only together

They became important only together
with the state of the organism; say, its need for food. The

enticements and warnings acquired and interpreted with the
help of the a priori structure of the organism. We have seen that, even in bacteria, theories or
hypotheses come before the signals, the 'sensations'. I need
hardly stress that, especially in science, hypotheses come
before what some scientists still call the 'data'; misleadingly,
because they are not given to us, but actively (and sometimes

the organism states of enticement or of repulsion, and it may
make possible the release of prepared actions upon the
environment. Thus, the invention of a highly universal
theory (in this case the invention of a sense organ) may come
before the observation (the use of the sense organ): it makes
observation possible and introduces it into the set of actions
that are available to the organism. And so it is itself an
adaptation, found by trial and error.

otherwise) are trials, inventions; they are not the results of
many observations; they are not derived from many data. Clearly, the first invention of the eye was a great achieve­

further. And yet, we - in common with all animals - have

have, I believe, refuted classical empiricism - the bucket
theory of the mind that says that we obtain knowledge just
by opening our eyes and letting the sense-given or god-given
'data' stream into a brain that will digest them. Christopher Isherwood expressed this view by the title of
his book, I am a Camera. But when he chose this title he

things it cannot do; for example, it cannot improve itself; and
it cannot invent a new important problem, or a new tentative
solution. All organisms are problem finders and problem solvers.

Only with life do problems and values enter the

important new problems, or new values. Of these new values that we have invented, two seem to
me the most important for the evolution of knowledge: a self­
critical attitude - a value that we should always teach
ourselves to live up to; and truth - a value that we should
always seek our theories to live up to. The first of these values, a self-critical attitude, first enters

The first of these values, a self-critical attitude, first enters
the world with objective products of life, such as spiders'
webs, birds' nests, or beaver dams: products that can be
repaired or improved. The emergence of the self-critical
attitude is the beginning of something even more important: pp , pp
interest of objective truth. (I hope that it was the critical
approach that inspired the Founders of the London School
of Economics to choose the dam-repairing beaver for its
coat of arms.) Both of these values, the critical approach and objective

first and most important product of the human mind.
Language makes it possible to consider our theories
critically: to look at them as if they were external objects,
as if they belonged to the world outside of ourselves which
we share with others. Theories become objects of criticism,
like the beaver dam. And we can try to repair them in the

is only one step. Both work with the method of trial and
error. The amoeba must hate error, for it dies when it errs.

At this I shall rejoice that I was yet the means whereby
