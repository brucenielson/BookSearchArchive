(2) For Aristotle’s elaboration of these ideas, cp. esp. his Politics, III, 9, 1, 1280a (see also 1282b–1284b and 1301b29), where he writes: ‘All men cling to justice of some kind, but their conceptions are imperfect, and do not embrace the whole Idea. For example, justice is thought (by democrats) to be equality; and so it is, although it is not equality for all, but only for equals. And justice is thought (by oligarchs) to be inequality; and so it is, although it is not inequality for all, but only for unequals.’ Cp. also Nichom. Eth., 1131b27, 1158b30 ff.

3 It is by no means the only instance, as may be seen from my chapter 8. The passage quoted in the text to note 2, for example (Rep., 389b), is a different instance from the passage (Rep., 460a) which Professor Levinson has in mind. There are several other passages. See Rep., 415d and especially Tim., 18e, which prove that Plato finds his instruction to lie of sufficient importance to be included in the very brief summary of the Republic. (See also Laws, 663d down to 664b.)

Chapter Title: The Anti-Naturalistic Doctrines Of Historicism
Section Name: I
Content:
Historicism asserts that the historical relativity of social laws makes most of the methods of physics inapplicable to sociology. Typical historicist arguments on which this view is based concern generalization, experiment, the complexity of social phenomena, the difficulties of exact prediction, and the significance of methodological essentialism. I will treat these arguments in turn.


This section grabbed the chapter number (in roman numerals) and made it a section (subsection) name.

Section Name: II
Content:
By saying that it is a theoretical discipline we mean that sociology has to explain and to predict events, with the help of theories or of universal laws (which it tries to discover). By describing sociology as empirical, we mean to say that it is backed by experience, that the events it explains and predicts are observable facts, and that observation is the basis for the acceptance or rejection of any propounded theory. When we speak of success in physics we have in mind the success of its predictions: and the success of its predictions can be said to be the same as the empirical corroboration of the laws of physics. When we contrast the relative success of sociology with the success of physics, then we are assuming that success in sociology would likewise consist, basically, in the corroboration of predictions. It follows that certain methods—prediction with the help of laws, and the testing of laws by observation—must be common to physics and sociology.

<Lost Chapter Title>
Content:
When I was twenty I became apprenticed to an old master cabinetmaker in Vienna whose name was Adalbert Pösch, and I worked with him from 1922 to 1924, not long after the First World War. He looked exactly like Georges Clemenceau, but he was a very mild and kind man. After I had gained his confidence he would often, when we were alone in his workshop, give me the benefit of his inexhaustible store of knowledge. Once he told me that he had worked for many years on various models of a perpetual motion machine, adding musingly: “They say you can’t make it; but once it’s been made they’ll talk different!” (“Da sag’n s’ dass ma’ so was net mach’n kann; aber wann amal eina ein’s g’macht hat, dann wer’n s’ schon anders red’n!”) A favourite practice of his was to ask me a historical question and to answer it himself when it turned out that I did not know the answer (although I, his pupil, was a University student—a fact of which he was very proud). “And do you know”, he would ask, “who invented topboots? You don’t? It was Wallenstein, the Duke of Friedland, during the Thirty Years War.” After one or two even more difficult questions, posed by himself and triumphantly answered by himself, my master would say with modest pride: “There, you can ask me whatever you like: I know everything.” (“Da können S’ mi’ frag’n was Sie woll’n: ich weiss alles.”)

Why are both of these (in 'post') on page 1? This is in the middle of the chapter near the end!

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Item Id: Ch011
Paragraph Num: 145
Page Number: 1
Chapter Title: 11 The Demarcation between Science and Metaphysics
Section Name: 6. Probability and Induction
Item Num: 4
Content:
One might still say, perhaps, that there is no apriorism here since the dependencies mentioned are a consequence of a definition (that of probability or degree of confirmation), which rests on a convention or a ‘decision’, and is therefore analytic. But Carnap gives two reasons for his choice of his confirmation function which do not seem to fit this view. The first of the two reasons I have in mind is that his confirmation function, as he remarks, is the only one (among those which suggest themselves) ‘which is not entirely inadequate’;88 inadequate, that is, for explaining (or ‘explicating’) the undoubted fact that we can learn from experience. Now this fact is empirical; and a theory whose adequacy is judged by its ability to explain or cohere with this fact does not quite look like being analytic. It is interesting to see that Carnap’s argument in favour of his choice of λ (which I am suspecting of apriorism) is the same as Kant’s or Russell’s, or Jeffreys’s; it is what Kant called a ‘transcendental’ argument (‘How is knowledge possible?’), the appeal to the fact that we possess empirical knowledge, i.e. that we can learn from experience. The second of the two reasons is Carnap’s argument that the adoption of an appropriate λ (one which is neither infinite, for an infinite λ is equivalent to independence, nor zero) would be more successful in nearly all universes (except in the two extreme cases in which all individuals are independent or have like properties). All these reasons seem to me to suggest that the choice of λ, i.e. of a confirmation function, is to depend upon its success, or upon the probability of its success, in the world. But then it would not be analytic—in spite of the fact that it is also a ‘decision’ concerning the adoption of a definition. I think that it can be explained how this may be so. We can, if we like, define the word ‘truth’ so that it comprises some of those statements we usually call ‘false’.

Item Num: 4
Content:
We can, if we like, define the word ‘truth’ so that it comprises some of those statements we usually call ‘false’. Similarly we can define ‘probable’ or ‘confirmed’ so that absurd statements get a ‘high probability’. All this is purely conventional or verbal, as long as we do not take these definitions as ‘adequate explications’. But if we do, then the question is no longer conventional, or analytic. For to say of a contingent or factual statement x that it is true, in an adequate sense of the word ‘true’, is to make a factual statement; and so it is with ‘x is (now) highly probable’. It is the same with ‘x is strongly dependent upon y’ and ‘x is independent of y’—the statements whose fate is decided upon when we choose λ. The choice of λ is therefore indeed equivalent to that of adopting a sweeping though unformulated statement about the general interdependence or uniformity of the world.
