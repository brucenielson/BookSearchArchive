Paragraph Num: 6
Book Title: The Poverty of Historicism
Section Id: ch11
Chapter Title: The Pro-Naturalistic Doctrines Of Historicism
Section Name: 11 Comparison With Astronomy. Long-Term Forecasts And Large-Scale Forecasts1

Can I get rid of footnotes?



Various problems with:
Book Title: The World of Parmenides
Section Id: Ch02
Page Number: 67
Chapter Title: An Attempt To Establish His Greatness: Addendum 1
Section Name: The Unknown Xenophanes
Header 2: A Note To The Quotation From Xenophanes (Dk 21B25) In Section 4 Above
Content:

Section Name is really name of chapter. Why did it skip "Essay 2"? Chapter Title is subtitle. Then we keep adding 'Addendums' on (happens in previous chapter too)






Everything in this chapter:

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Item Num: 7
Item Id: Ch014
Paragraph Num: 1
Page Number: 409
Chapter Title: 14 Self-Reference and Meaning in Ordinary Language
Content:
Theaetetus. Now listen to me attentively, Socrates, for what I shall put before you is not a little tricky.
Socrates. I promise to do my best, Theaetetus, so long as you spare me the details of your achievements in the theory of numbers, and speak in a language which I, an ordinary man, can understand.

It dumps nearly everything into the second paragraph.




'Von Den Neuesten … Zusammengestohlen Aus Verschiedenem, Diesem Und Jenen*'



Addendum 1 is not part of the title BUT it needs its own section:

Item Id: Ch01
Paragraph Num: 81
Page Number: 29
Chapter Title: Back To The Presocratics: Addendum 1
Chapter Title: Essay 1: Back To The Presocratics
Section Name: Essay 1
Subsection Name: A Historical Note On Verisimilitude (1964)
Content:

I now have:
Book Title: The World of Parmenides
Item Id: Ch01
Paragraph #: 80
Page #: 29
Chapter Title: Essay 1: Back To The Presocratics
Section Name: A Historical Note On Verisimilitude (1964)
Item #: 3
Content:
Some further remarks on the early history of the confusion between verisimilitude and probability (in addition to those in the Introduction) will be given here.
1. In brief, my thesis is this. The earliest sayings at our disposal unambiguously use the idea of truthlikeness or verisimilitude. In time, ‘like the truth’ becomes ambiguous: it acquires additional meanings such as ‘likely’ or ‘likely to be true’ or ‘probable’ or ‘possible’, so that in some cases it is not clear which meaning is intended.

This should have been Addendum 1: A Historical Note On Verisimilitude (1964)
So we're losing Addenum 1 for some reason.


Same:
Item Id: Ch02
Paragraph Num: 120
Page Number: 67
Chapter Title: An attempt to establish his greatness: Addendum 1
Chapter Title: An attempt to establish his greatness
Section Name: The Unknown Xenophanes
Subsection Name: A Note To The Quotation From Xenophanes (Dk 21B25) In Section 4 Above
Content:


This one should have "Addendum 2"
Item Id: Ch02
Paragraph Num: 127
Page Number: 70
Chapter Title: An attempt to establish his greatness: Addendum 1: Addendum 2
Chapter Title: An attempt to establish his greatness
Section Name: The Unknown Xenophanes
Subsection Name: Some Principles For A New Professional Ethics Based On Xenophanes’ Theory Of Truth
Content:

I don't think 'An attempt to establish his greatness' should be the chapter title. It should be 'Addendum 2'
