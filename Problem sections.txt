(2) For Aristotle’s elaboration of these ideas, cp. esp. his Politics, III, 9, 1, 1280a (see also 1282b–1284b and 1301b29), where he writes: ‘All men cling to justice of some kind, but their conceptions are imperfect, and do not embrace the whole Idea. For example, justice is thought (by democrats) to be equality; and so it is, although it is not equality for all, but only for equals. And justice is thought (by oligarchs) to be inequality; and so it is, although it is not inequality for all, but only for unequals.’ Cp. also Nichom. Eth., 1131b27, 1158b30 ff.




This entry lacks a chapter title which should be either "10" or "The Open Society and Its Enemies" when I look at the EPUB itself

Book Title: The Open Society and Its Enemies (New One-Volume Edition)
Item Num: 13
Item Id: chapter10
Paragraph Num: 150
Page Number: 212
Section Name: Addenda
Subsection Name: IV (1965)
Content:
3 It is by no means the only instance, as may be seen from my chapter 8. The passage quoted in the text to note 2, for example (Rep., 389b), is a different instance from the passage (Rep., 460a) which Professor Levinson has in mind. There are several other passages. See Rep., 415d and especially Tim., 18e, which prove that Plato finds his instruction to lie of sufficient importance to be included in the very brief summary of the Republic. (See also Laws, 663d down to 664b.)

Book Title: Unended Quest
Section Id: footnotes
Chapter Title: NOTES
Header 1: NOTES
Header 3: Scruples Of Conscience
Page Number: 280
Content:

Header 1 to Header 3 without a header 2

I think I may want this one to NOT have a section header and instead be treated as text. Perhaps detect that by a jump in header levels?






Paragraph Num: 2
Book Title: The Poverty of Historicism
Section Id: ch10
Section Name: The Anti-Naturalistic Doctrines Of Historicism
Chapter Title: The Anti-Naturalistic Doctrines Of Historicism
Section Name: I
Content:
Historicism asserts that the historical relativity of social laws makes most of the methods of physics inapplicable to sociology. Typical historicist arguments on which this view is based concern generalization, experiment, the complexity of social phenomena, the difficulties of exact prediction, and the significance of methodological essentialism. I will treat these arguments in turn.


This section grabbed the chapter number (in roman numerals) and made it a section (subsection) name.




Paragraph Num: 6
Book Title: The Poverty of Historicism
Section Id: ch11
Chapter Title: The Pro-Naturalistic Doctrines Of Historicism
Section Name: 11 Comparison With Astronomy. Long-Term Forecasts And Large-Scale Forecasts1

Can I get rid of footnotes?



Various problems with:
Book Title: The World of Parmenides
Section Id: Ch02
Page Number: 67
Chapter Title: An Attempt To Establish His Greatness: Addendum 1
Section Name: The Unknown Xenophanes
Header 2: A Note To The Quotation From Xenophanes (Dk 21B25) In Section 4 Above
Content:

Section Name is really name of chapter. Why did it skip "Essay 2"? Chapter Title is sub title. Then we keep adding 'Addendums' on (happens in previous chapter too)






Everything in this chapter:

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Item Num: 7
Item Id: Ch014
Paragraph Num: 1
Page Number: 409
Chapter Title: 14 Self-Reference and Meaning in Ordinary Language
Content:
Theaetetus. Now listen to me attentively, Socrates, for what I shall put before you is not a little tricky.
Socrates. I promise to do my best, Theaetetus, so long as you spare me the details of your achievements in the theory of numbers, and speak in a language which I, an ordinary man, can understand.

It dumps nearly everything into the second paragraph.

Addendum 1 is not part of the title BUT it needs its own section:

I now have:
Book Title: The World of Parmenides
Item Id: Ch01
Paragraph #: 80
Page #: 29
Chapter Title: Essay 1: Back To The Presocratics
Section Name: A Historical Note On Verisimilitude (1964)
Item #: 3
Content:
Some further remarks on the early history of the confusion between verisimilitude and probability (in addition to those in the Introduction) will be given here.
1. In brief, my thesis is this. The earliest sayings at our disposal unambiguously use the idea of truthlikeness or verisimilitude. In time, ‘like the truth’ becomes ambiguous: it acquires additional meanings such as ‘likely’ or ‘likely to be true’ or ‘probable’ or ‘possible’, so that in some cases it is not clear which meaning is intended.

This should have been Addendum 1: A Historical Note On Verisimilitude (1964)
So we're losing Addenum 1 for some reason.
