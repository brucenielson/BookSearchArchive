Theaetetus. Now listen to me attentively, Socrates, for what I shall put before you is not a little tricky.
Socrates. I promise to do my best, Theaetetus, so long as you spare me the details of your achievements in the theory of numbers, and speak in a language which I, an ordinary man, can understand.

It dumps nearly everything into the second paragraph.

Paragraph #: 44

Section Name: Addenda
Subsection Name: I: Facts, Standards, And Truth: A Further Criticism Of Relativism (1961)
Item #: 27
Content:
The main philosophical malady of our time is an intellectual and moral relativism, the latter being at least in part based upon the former. By relativism—or, if you like, scepticism—I mean here, briefly, the theory that the choice between competing theories is arbitrary; since either, there is no such thing as objective truth; or, if there is, no such thing as a theory which is true or at any rate (though perhaps not true) nearer to the truth than another theory; or, if there are two or more theories, no ways or means of deciding whether one of them is better than another.

Paragraph #: 46
Page #: 486
Section Name: Addenda
Subsection Name: I: Facts, Standards, And Truth: A Further Criticism Of Relativism (1961): 1. Truth
Item #: 27
Content:
Certain arguments in support of relativism arise from the question, asked in the tone of the assured sceptic who knows for certain that there is no answer: ‘What is truth?’ But Pilate’s question can be answered in a simple and reasonable way—though hardly in a way that would have satisfied him—as follows: an assertion, proposition, statement, or belief, is true if, and only if, it corresponds to the facts.

Shouldn't be tacking on so many subsections
