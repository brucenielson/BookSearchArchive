Content:
The present book, Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie, can be seen as a collection of drafts and preliminary work from the years 1930 to 1933 for my first published book, Logik der Forschung, the first edition of which appeared in the autumn of 1934. The title is an allusion to Schopenhauer’s Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik 1 (The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics). Earlier preliminary work, as well as some of the work from the years 1930 to 1933, has been lost.
1 Arthur Schopenhauer, Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, behandelt in zwei akademischen Preisschriften: I. Über die Freiheit des menschlichen Willens …, II. Über das Fundament der Moral … (1841; 2nd ed, 1860).
I had not planned on publishing this earlier work. As I have recounted in Section 16 of my autobiography,2 it was Herbert Feigl who in 1929 or 1930 encouraged me to write a book for publication, and who later arranged for me to meet Rudolf Carnap. Carnap read the manuscript of Die beiden Grundprobleme in the summer of 1932, and subsequently several members of the Vienna Circle read it as well. Carnap reported on the manuscript in the journal Erkenntnis,3 and Heinrich Gomperz wrote two detailed letters on it, one to me and one to Oskar Siebeck of the publishing house J.C.B. Mohr, which now, forty-six years later, is publishing the book.

1 In Plato’s Apology of Socrates – perhaps the most beautiful philosophical work I know – Socrates reports how surprised he was that the Delphic Oracle answered “No” to the question of whether anyone was wiser than Socrates. What does the god mean? Socrates asked himself, knowing full well that he was not wise. And he arrived at the following conclusion: “I am indeed a little wiser than the others because I know that I do not know. But the others do not even know that much; for they believe that they know something.”
Socrates’ insight into our ignorance, “I know that I know (almost) nothing”, is of the greatest significance. Often this insight has not been taken very seriously; it has even been held to be paradoxical; and certainly, in the Apology the formulation is intended to sound rather surprising and paradoxical.1
1 “I know that I know nothing” might be considered as a variant of the paradox of the liar (“What I say now is false”). Inserting the word “almost” formally avoids the appearance of the paradox. Therefore “scepticism” (at least in this sense) is certainly not “obviously nonsensical”, as Wittgenstein says (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1918/1922, Proposition 6.51). Also the classic formulation of scepticism, “There is no universal criterion of truth”, is far from being nonsensical: indeed, scepticism in this sense is a true theory. However, one certainly ought not to infer from this that there can be no progress in the sciences.

1. The problem of induction and the problem of demarcation
This analysis focuses on two questions: the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation.
The problem of induction:
We are only able to observe particular events, and always only a limited number of them. Nonetheless, the empirical sciences advance universal propositions, such as the natural laws; that is, propositions which should hold true for an unlimited number of events. What is the justification for advancing such propositions? What is actually meant by these propositions? These questions indicate in outline the problem of induction. The “problem of induction” will denote the question concerning the validity or justification of universal propositions of the empirical sciences. Or, put another way, can empirical propositions that are based on experience be universally valid? (Or more simply, can we know more than we know?)

2. Comments on how the solutions are reached and preliminary presentation of the solutions
Are we justified in calling the problem of induction, but even more so the problem of demarcation, the fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge?
Are we justified in regarding the theory of knowledge as the methodology of the empirical sciences?
Evidently, these questions can only be answered through an analysis that takes into account the historical circumstances. However, such analysis need not, as a consequence, have a historical interest. It will only have to show that the typical problems that have, time and again, been dealt with by the theory of knowledge, are reducible to the problem of induction and then to the problem of demarcation; and it will also have to show that these problems may be viewed as methodological problems, and that such a view is a productive one.

5. The infinite regression (Hume's argument)
Hume1 was the first who presented, with exemplary clarity, the difficulties surrounding the problem of universal empirical statements, or the problem of induction (“Can we know more than we know?”). He demonstrated that every attempt at inductive generalisation will be defeated by a circular inference.
1 [David Hume, A Treatise on Human Nature (1739/1740), Book I, Part III, Section VI. Ed.]
This argument will be presented here in detail: it is the crucial idea of the whole problem area. The presentation will deviate from Hume on some points of only minor relevance to the subject. (In particular, Hume’s circular inference will be replaced by a so-called regressus in infinitum.*1) This does not, however, alter Hume’s fundamental idea that in analysing any inductive generalisation, one will necessarily encounter impermissible logical operations.

7. The normal-statement positions: naive inductivism, strict positivism and apriorism
The normal-statement positions on inductivism assume that all empirical statements are “normal” statements, that is, that they are decidably true or false.*1 It “is essential for a genuine statement”, says Schlick,1 “that it be in principle finally verifiable or falsifiable”. If “strict universal empirical statements” exist at all, then the same will also apply to them.
*1 What is meant is: “normal” statements have a logical form such that, if they are true, their truth is decidable, and if they are false, their falsity is decidable; that is, decidable by experience.

11. Supplement to the critique of apriorism
(Psychologism and transcendentalism in Kant and Fries. – On the question of the empirical basis.) The present rather lengthy section ought, strictly speaking, to be characterised as a digression. While in this part of the book there is otherwise no digression from the analysis of the problem of induction, this section will present a number of related problems in some detail. It will not, however, change the position we have already reached in discussing the problem of induction. The next section will therefore resume the argument from the end of the preceding section.
Thus, the analysis in this section is intended not to move the discussion forward but rather to deepen it, particularly with respect to the question of the epistemological method. Although, in a certain sense, this section represents merely a collection of critical reflections, nevertheless it serves the important purpose of showing that a systematic comparison of the transcendental and the psychological methods is an illuminating and promising way of getting closer to the solution of epistemological problems.

12. The probability positions – subjective belief in probability
The normal-statement positions cannot be satisfactory:
Naive inductivism is logically untenable; it is directly refuted by Hume’s argument.
Strict positivism is logically consistent, but epistemologically (transcendentally) unsatisfactory. It does not provide an explanation for the existence of natural laws, and cannot give an adequate interpretation of theoretical natural science. It offers too little.
Apriorism, on the other hand, offers too much. It “proves” the absolute a priori validity of certain empirical statements; but empirical science will find it hard to accept the view that there are empirical statements that are necessarily valid and in principle irrefutable by experience.
This is where the probability positions enter, which seem to overcome all of these difficulties. They agree with positivism (and empirical science) that universal empirical statements can never be ultimately verified; like apriorism (and again like empirical science) they acknowledge that natural laws are strictly universal empirical statements.

18. The pseudo-statement positions: new formulation of the problem
The preceding considerations allow us to make a generalisation that is decisive for the problem situation.
If a statement is not to be regarded as valid, then this must be expressed by a statement about that statement; regardless of whether that statement is to be called “false” or perhaps “probable”, or whether we wish to assign to it any other truth value whatsoever (except for the value “true”).
Only if this second statement, or some other higher-order statement, can be unconditionally true will the regression stop. However, should none of these statements be considered unconditionally true, then the infinite regression will be inevitable. Putting all these statements together, we have in effect said nothing.
As a result, we no longer have any reason to add another truth value to “two-valued logic”. (In principle, singular empirical statements must always be definitively verifiable or falsifiable; and such a step can be of no benefit to universal empirical statements.)

24. The pseudo-statement positions will temporarily be put away: conventionalism
Conventionalism regards natural laws as genuine statements. Therefore, it is not a pseudo-statement position.
In contrast to all previously discussed views, conventionalism is deductivist: this is one reason why it is of interest. Discussing it does not, however, properly belong to a critical analysis of the inductivist positions.
Conventionalism is distinguished from the deductivist and empiricist theory of knowledge (which I advocate) above all by the fact that it must be characterised as non-empiricist. According to the conventionalist view, experience cannot decide the truth or falsity of natural laws. According to conventionalism, natural laws are analytic judgements because they are (hidden) definitions, arbitrary stipulations, “conventions”.

31. Implication and general implication
Our critical discussion of the pseudo-statement positions was interrupted in order to enable us to analyse (in sections 24–30) the set of problems posed by conventionalism, above all in order to allow a closer characterisation of the first pseudo-statement position.
On that occasion, logical (logistical) questions were discussed in perhaps greater detail than was absolutely necessary. This was done in part because a polemical treatment was desirable, but also because the terminological machinery acquired in that process will be needed in a further discussion, which is also polemical. Only after concluding this discussion can we return to the critique of the pseudo-statement positions.
This second polemic concerns the relationship between general implications on the one hand and universal and singular statements on the other.

36. Return to the discussion of the pseudo-statement positions
A brief recapitulation, from the start of our discussion of the pseudo-statement positions, should serve to recall the course of our analysis so far.
The pseudo-statement positions deny natural laws the character of genuine propositions to which truth values can be assigned. If this position were accepted, the problem of induction, or the question of the validity of natural laws, would disappear. It would be not a genuine problem, but only a pseudo-problem caused by the misunderstanding by which natural laws are regarded as genuine statements.
This idea – which we owe to Wittgenstein and Schlick – leads to the question being posed in a new form: What are natural laws if they are not genuine propositions?
The answer1 that natural laws are “rules for the transformation of statements” was accepted here tentatively, but it was not considered satisfactory. For such rules might also be genuine propositions. To the new formulation of the question had to be added the demand that natural laws be so defined that their character as pseudo-statements is put beyond doubt.

43. The concept of meaning in logical positivism
In the writings of logical positivists, the concept of meaning is of paramount significance. There can be no doubt that Wittgenstein’s and Schlick’s pseudo-statement positions can be understood only in connection with the concept of meaning, which is why this concept will be presented here in detail. (To the extent that the structure of my presentation permits it, I shall use quotations.)
Before one can even ask about a proposition being true or false, one must know whether it has a meaning or whether it is nonsensical. The (putative) proposition “Socrates is identical” is nonsensical; and it would also be nonsensical to ask whether it is true or false.
It is one of Wittgenstein’s fundamental ideas that the grammatically correct form of a proposition offers no guarantee that it is meaningful.

47. The dialectical and the transcendental corroboration of the solution
The critique of inductivist attempts to solve the problem of induction has been concluded. What has it achieved?
Even the sharpest polemic in this investigation was designed, first and foremost, to serve a positive purpose. But what is this purpose, and how should it be assessed?
I see the primary value of the critical-polemical form in being an acid test of the positive solution. We should not, of course, overrate this form of testing. Its sole value consists, essentially, in making the proposed solution fit for discussion.
One might also call this critical-polemical test a dialectical corroboration of the solution, because (to characterise this method in the words of H. Gomperz 1) it “lets every attempted solution … emerge from the contradictions that another attempt has encountered, either with its own assumptions or with concepts of the individual sciences or of scientific practice”, and because it seeks to show that the proposed solution “contains within itself, in ‘preserved’ form, the justified elements of earlier attempted resolutions”.

Is there a philosophical science? (Introductory considerations on the problem of demarcation.)
An investigation in an individual science, say in physics, can begin straight away with the formulation of the problem. It is possible “to enter the house through open doors”, as it were; for a “house” exists: a structure of scientific theory, a generally recognised problem situation. The researcher can count on the reader (who can be expected to be familiar with the discipline’s prerequisites) to fit the new work into the overall context of scientific knowledge.
A philosopher finds himself in an entirely different situation. He faces not a theoretical edifice but a heap of ruins. He cannot take as his starting point a generally recognised problem situation; for the only thing that is generally recognised is, most often, that there is none. Indeed, it is even fashionable in philosophical circles to assert that nothing like a genuine philosophical problem can exist at all.

1. The problem of demarcation
What distinguishes the empirical sciences from the non-empirical sciences and from extra-scientific domains?
Is there a criterion that demarcates the empirical sciences from non-empirical domains? A criterion that marks out some statements or systems of statements as empirical, and others as non-empirical?
I call the question about such a demarcation criterion the “demarcation problem”.
The demarcation problem is the fundamental problem of the theory of knowledge: all epistemological questions can be reduced to it.
2. Scope of the problem of demarcation
Instead of the question:
What is knowledge?
(which, in this form, can surely lead to little but a fruitless quarrel about nominal definitions, for definitions are always arbitrary), we could start by asking the narrower question:

Section Title: II. ON THE QUESTION OF ELIMINATING SUBJECTIVIST PSYCHOLOGISM - ch14
Content:
DOI: 10.4324/9780203371107-17
The deductivist, transcendentalist and objectivist view of science advocated here, differs in a truly fundamental way from any inductivist, psychologistic and subjectivist view of science such as the one advocated by (for example) modern positivism. Inductivism (positivism) regards our perceptions (and perhaps other experiences also) as the foundation of all knowledge, of all science. This basic theme is common to all positivist approaches, although they interpret it in a variety of different ways. Some go so far as to regard scientific statements as being “only” logical constructions of experiences; others regard the concepts of empirical science as “only” logical constructions (classes of classes, classes of relations) of elementary experiences. The transcendental untenability of this view, and the logical difficulty of treating irrational elements (which is what our experiences are) logically and rationally, lead positivism ultimately (while not abandoning its basic position) to replace irrational experiences with rational constructs, namely with perceptual statements (“protocol sentences”). The foundations of science are to be constituted no longer by our irrational perceptions, but by the rationalised linguistic expression of these perceptions.

1. An objection to the criterion of falsifiability
The following objection can be raised, and quite rightly so, to the proposed solutions to the demarcation problem2 and to the problem of induction:
2 [See Editor’s Postscript. Ed.]
Admittedly, so this objection may be formulated, scientific theories represent non-verifiable systems; they are not, however, unverifiable only, but unfalsifiable also. Every theoretical system can be protected against empirical falsification, and in a variety of ways. One can introduce auxiliary hypotheses to “explain” the observations that threaten the theoretical system, that is, to bring them into agreement with the system; or one can amend the “coordinative definitions” (or whatever takes their place if not working with “coordinative definitions”, as in the view advocated here). In other words, one can alter the empirical meaning assigned to the concepts ([or] the terms) that occur in the theory. Finally, one can simply exclude the unfavourable observations by declaring them to be “fabricated”, “unscientific”, “non-objective” or something of this sort. Any one of these procedures, and even more so in combination, makes it possible to protect a theory against falsification. The reference to the one-sided falsifiability of theories, therefore, is not a sound argument and is incapable of paving the way for a solution of the epistemological problems. There is, moreover, no asymmetry between positive and negative truth values, between verification and falsification. The proposed solution to the problem of induction should be rejected, because natural laws are not “partially decidable” but not decidable at all. The proposed solution to the demarcation problem should be rejected because scientific theories are not falsifiable, which entails that falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation would exclude them from science (as a result of which, the arguments raised against Wittgenstein’s criterion of meaning3 would now be turned against the position advocated here).

The term “method of exhaustion” was coined by Dingler.2 He is probably unique among modern methodologists in forcefully emphasising that we address reality with our theoretical questions, and “exhaust” it with the help of our theories. We capture only those things that find space in our receptacle (the theory).

Principle of falsifiability
Empirical scientific statements or systems of statements are distinguished by being empirically falsifiable.
Singular empirical statements can be empirically verifiable also; theoretical systems, natural laws and universal empirical statements are, in principle, one-sidedly falsifiable only.
The theory of method explains in further detail what is to be understood by “empirical falsification” and “empirical verification”. It explains also the conditions (the “methodological decisions”) designed to ensure the empirical falsifiability of empirical statements and systems of statements.
1. Principle of continuity
So long as any system of hypotheses is to be regarded as not falsified, the application of the following rules notwithstanding, it is regarded as corroborated. The rule is: all admissible means of escaping falsification should be used.

Content:
The situation in contemporary philosophy is characterised by the opposition between the proponents of “metaphysics” and those of “anti-metaphysics”.
The question at the centre of this controversy is the one about the relationship between philosophy and the empirical sciences.
The metaphysician is quite wary of empirical science. Recent upheavals in the natural sciences in particular, having rocked the very foundations of their systems, strike him as an alarming symptom of an internal crisis, as a consequence of the alienation of empirical research from its philosophical basis; for only philosophy can provide the ultimate justification of empirical science.
The anti-metaphysician admires the rapid developments in modern natural science. It appears to him that the more profoundly these developments rock its foundations, the more powerful its empirical, non-philosophical character will become. Empirical science seems to be freeing itself from the inhibiting prejudices of its metaphysical past. In the attitude of metaphysics towards modern natural science, the anti-metaphysician can see only uncomprehending presumptuousness. Empirical science is autonomous. It needs no philosophy to provide it with any “foundations”. There is no longer any need for a philosophical science superordinate to the individual sciences. The supposed problems of philosophy prove to be meaningless or even nonsensical pseudo-problems. Much like Kant1 (“philosophy can never be learned … we can at most learn to philosophise”), although more radically, the anti-metaphysician declares that philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity.2

[Introduction.]
Is there a philosophical science? Are there, beside the empirical sciences, beside logic and mathematics, other sciences that have a specific, a “philosophical” character?
I believe that to pose the question is to answer it. By speaking about empirical science, about logic and mathematics, about the relationships between these sciences, by asking whether there is a “science”, we have already constituted a system of concepts that belong to a domain we should probably have to identify as “philosophy”. The concept “empirical science” is not a concept of empirical science. The concept “logic” is not a concept of logic. The concept “mathematics” is not a concept of mathematics. All these concepts belong to a theory of science.
It would seem obvious, furthermore, that the concept of a “theory of science” cannot be a concept of the theory of science. And this is quite true. We arrive at a kind of hierarchy of analytical types, each one investigating the nature of the type subordinate to it.*1 But this does not create a problem: we are not facing an infinite regression, for the truth of the statements that belong to the subordinate science is not deduced from that of the superordinate one. Each of these sciences has to fend for itself. (Compare Nelson’s critique.1>)

1. Methodology and the possibility of falsification
We began by examining theoretical statements, in order to see whether by virtue of their logical form they permit strict verification through singular statements. This has proved not to be the case. Instead of trying, as it were, to circumvent this negative result and replace a strict form of verification with a more relaxed form, which would have entangled us in the difficulties of the problem of induction, we abandoned the idea of verification in any form and turned to falsification. It seems to us that falsification attempts offer the only possibility of testing a theory empirically.
We had to turn to a logical investigation of the falsifiability of a theory. We were able to develop falsifiability as a relationship between a theory and its possible empirical basic statements. This shifted the question logically to the problem of basic statements.

[1. Introduction.]
The supposed problem of free will emerges with full force within a “deterministic” world view only, that is, where physics (to put it a little simplistically) draws a picture of the world that resembles the movement of a clock. Modern quantum physics, with its “non-deterministic” probability statements, seems more likely to blur the problem of free will than to solve it. More precisely, this blurring of the problem is caused not by physics itself, of course, but by impermissible interpretations.
I believe that we shall gain a much clearer understanding of the question of free will, if we stand back completely from contemporary physics and ask ourselves how the problem would appear if we imagined a completely deterministic physics.
Let us pose the problem as specifically as possible, if only in an “ad hominem” fashion. If, as a consequence of a deterministic world view, we regarded the creations of Bach or of Michelangelo, for example, as nothing but the outcomes of necessary physical processes, the products of an automatic physical apparatus, something in us would rebel against accepting such a consequence. If we imagined all the physical processes in the world as determined by the constellation of initial conditions and natural laws, then whether we liked it or not we would have to assume that the works of Bach and of Michelangelo were contained in them already in nuce, that is, we would find ourselves almost irretrievably within a metaphysics of pre-established harmony.

5. Individuals and universals
Even though we can never provide anything approaching a complete description of a “slice of reality”, we can always give it a name; we can characterise it in individual terms. Here, once again, we encounter the problem of universals. We have established already2 that it is impossible to replace an individual concept, or to identify an individual unambiguously, by any number of universals. We encounter the same opposition in the relationship between “event” and “slice of reality”; for if we could describe a “slice of reality” unambiguously, we could replace its name by a description.

[Introduction.]
Only from the vantage point of the frequency interpretation1 of probability statements is it possible to formulate precisely the distinctive paradox inherent in all probability arguments, a paradox that constitutes the one aspect of probability that is most in need of an epistemological clarification.
1 [See Karl Popper, Logik der Forschung (1934), Chapter VI (2nd ed., 1966, Chapter VIII) [The Logic of Scientific Discover (1959; 2nd ed., 1968), Chapter VIII. Tr.]. Ed.]
This paradox consists in the following: there are particular classes of events to which we tend to apply a very characteristic and perplexing form of expression. When it becomes apparent, for particular series of events*1 that belong to such a class, that we are unable to come up with predictions for the individual events in these series, from this impossibility of predicting an individual event we infer the possibility of making a prediction for the whole series; that is, a frequency prediction.

1. Introduction
This edition of The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge contains everything that could be found2 of the original copies of the manuscript. Despite tireless efforts3 to track down the missing parts, it has proved impossible to publish a complete edition of this two-volume work, written in the years 1930–1933. Volume I: The Problem of Induction appears to have been preserved in its entirety,4 whereas almost the whole manuscript of Volume II: The Problem of Demarcation must be presumed lost. Of this volume, there exist a few fragments only and the drastically abridged version published in 1934 under the title Logik der Forschung.5 This book and two short papers (1933–1935) on induction and demarcation in the journal Erkenntnis 6 are all that has been published to date (January 1979) of The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge.7

Preface
This collection of essays and talks may be seen as a sequel to my book In Search of a Better World. Both contain some contributions strongly oriented towards the natural sciences, and others strongly oriented towards history or politics. The title All Life is Problem Solving is also the title of Chapter 9, which strongly influenced the short but relevant ‘Summary By Way of a Preface’ in that earlier collection. Here too, I have tried to give the preface more weight than prefaces usually have.
The selection of chapters has been made with the help and advice of my assistant, Mrs Melitta Mew, and Dr Klaus Stadler from Piper Verlag. I am deeply grateful to them both.
I
The first part of this book is called ‘Questions of natural science’. What I have in mind are mainly biology and the unfathomable wealth of living forms.

The Logic and Evolution of Scientific Theory*
The central idea I should like to present in this talk may be expressed in the following way.
The natural as well as the social sciences always start from problems, from the fact that something inspires amazement in us, as the Greek philosophers used to say. To solve these problems, the sciences use fundamentally the same method that common sense employs, the method of trial and error. To be more precise, it is the method of trying out solutions to our problem and then discarding the false ones as erroneous. This method assumes that we work with a large number of experimental solutions. One solution after another is put to the test and eliminated.
At bottom, this procedure seems to be the only logical one. It is also the procedure that a lower organism, even a single-cell amoeba, uses when trying to solve a problem. In this case we speak of testing movements through which the organism tries to rid itself of a troublesome problem. Higher organisms are able to learn through trial and error how a certain problem should be solved. We may say that they too make testing movements – mental testings – and that to learn is essentially to try out one testing movement after another until one is found that solves the problem. We might compare the animal’s successful solution to an expectation and hence to a hypothesis or a theory. For the animal’s behaviour shows us that it expects (perhaps unconsciously or dispositionally) that in a similar case the same testing movements will again solve the problem in question.

Notes of a Realist on the Body–Mind Problem*
As far as I can recall, my lecture here is only the third I have given in Germany. It is certainly the first in Mannheim. I do not come here all that often, and so I have had to choose my topic carefully.
I
Originally I thought of speaking today about my first book, about the solution of the two basic problems of epistemology: that is, first, the problem of demarcating between empirical science and other thoroughly meaningful and important fields such as metaphysics; and second, the problem of induction. But my solution to these problems is familiar and available in my book The Logic of Scientific Discovery; and although I have some new and hitherto unpublished results, I was afraid of giving the impression that even in old age I have not gone beyond the issues with which I started out.

Epistemology and the Problem of Peace*
I
May I say that I am very happy to see the unexpectedly large number of young people here? I plan to undertake quite a long and adventurous journey with you, and so perhaps I should first introduce myself.
Today, at eighty-three years of age, I am the happiest person I know. I find life indescribably wonderful. It is undoubtedly also terrible, and I have experienced painfully sad deaths among my close relations and friends. Sixteen of my close relatives fell victim to Hitler, some in Auschwitz, some by suicide. But despite everything, although I was desperate more than once and still today have grave worries, although for me it has been up one minute and down the next, I am happy.
I will not spend much longer on myself. What I feel is stated well in the first eight lines of the Prologue in Heaven in Goethe’s Faust. I see the world as he does:

The Epistemological Position of Evolutionary Epistemology*
A Priori – A Posteriori
I should like to start by saying something about apriorism. First, I do not want anyone to tell me what terminology I should use. The main thing is that the terminology is clear. And the term ‘genetically a priori’ is completely clear, in my view at least. It means that something already exists before the a posteriori, before any perception. Besides, it is necessary to keep using the term ‘a priori’ because precisely here there is a quite definite relation to Kantianism. In my opinion, Kant becomes much more intelligible if one is clear that, very often at least, he meant ‘genetically a priori’, although of course he always spoke of ‘a priori valid’.
Second, I should like to say that my view of Kant’s a priori is completely different from the view developed by Konrad Lorenz many years ago. I have often spoken of this with Konrad Lorenz; but I am not exactly sure what his current view is. At the time when he wrote about Kantianism and published his interpretation, he thought that our remote ancestors got to know things through perception and that these things were then somehow taken from perception into the genetic structure; they thus became a priori for us, genetically a priori. My own view is completely different: that is, my theory, not my use of the concepts, is different. And theories are a hundred times more important than concepts. (Theories may be true or false. Concepts can at best be adequate and at worst be misleading. Concepts are unimportant, in comparison with theories.)

Towards an Evolutionary Theory of Knowledge*
My dear Director, Ladies and Gentlemen,
In 1944 I was travelling with my wife in a bitterly cold bus, returning from a skiing holiday on Mount Cook. The bus stopped in the middle of nowhere, at a snowed-in rural New Zealand post office. To my surprise, I heard my name called, and someone handed me a telegram – the telegram that changed our lives. It was signed F.A. Hayek, and it offered me a Readership at the London School of Economics. The appointment followed in 1945, and in 1949 I was given the title of Professor of Logic and Scientific Method.
Today’s lecture to the Alumni of the School, for which you, Dr Patel, so kindly invited me, is the first public lecture I have ever been asked to give at the L.S.E. I hope, Dr Patel, that you will allow me to regard it, quite informally, as my slightly belated Inaugural Address. It is an occasion to which I have been looking forward eagerly for the last 40 years.

Kepler’s Metaphysics of the Solar System and his Empirical Criticism*
Yesterday – eight days before the 356th anniversary of Kepler’s death – marked another significant date in the story of Kepler. For 7 November 1631 was the day on which Pierre Gassendi observed and confirmed the passing of the planet Mercury in front of the sun, an event that Kepler had predicted two years before. Kepler was no longer able to witness this first empirical corroboration of his new theory of the planets. He had died the previous year, shortly before his fifty-ninth birthday.
First I must make it absolutely clear that I am no Kepler expert; I am no more than an enthusiastic admirer and follower. What fills me with enthusiasm is his glowing love and relentless quest for the truth, as we can see especially in his Astronomia Nova; but also the creative metaphysics that animates his whole work and reaches maturity in his magnificent Harmonices Mundi (Harmony of the World).

On Freedom*
I
We know little about the human settlement of the Austrian, Swiss, and French Alps, which goes back to prehistoric times. But we really ought to consider how it was that people who farmed and raised livestock moved into the wild, impassable valleys of the High Alps, where to begin with they could at best eke out a hard, meagre, and risk-filled existence. The most likely explanation is that these people preferred an uncertain life in the wilds to subjugation by more powerful neighbours. Despite the uncertainty and the danger, they chose freedom. I often like to play with the idea that the Swiss and Tyrolean tradition of freedom, in particular, goes back to those days of the prehistoric settlement of Switzerland.
It is in any case an interesting and striking fact that Britain and Switzerland, the two oldest democracies of contemporary Europe, are today so similar in their love of freedom and their readiness to defend it. For in many other respects, especially in their political origins, these two democracies are fundamentally different. British democracy owes its emergence to a sense of pride and independence among the upper nobility and, in its later development, to the Protestant mentality, personal conscience, and religious toleration – consequences of the great religious and political conflicts associated with the Puritan Revolution. Swiss democracy resulted not from the pride, independence, and individualism of an upper nobility, but from the pride, independence, and individualism of mountain farmers.

On the Theory of Democracy*
My greatest interest is in nature – and natural science or cosmology. Once I gave up Marxism in July 1919, I was interested in politics and political theory only as a citizen – and a democrat. But the totalitarian movements of Left and Right that arose in the 1920s and early 1930s, and finally Hitler’s seizure of power in Germany, forced me to give considerable thought to the problem of democracy.
Although my book The Open Society and Its Enemies did not once mention Hitler and the Nazis, it was intended as my contribution to the war against them. It is a theoretical defence of democracy against the old and new attacks of its enemies; it was first published in 1945 and has since been through many editions. But what I regard as its most important point seems not often to be properly understood.

All Life is Problem Solving*
I
I am almost as old as the motor car. I was not yet born when it was invented in 1886, but I was already a year old when Kaiser Wilhelm II (of whom I have a clear memory) acquired his first car.
My first car journey to Schloss Altenberg, near Greifenstein on the Danube, was in a Mercedes belonging to the owner of the castle, a friend of my father’s. Previously we had always been collected by a coach and four, but this time I was told we were going in a Mercedes, the best German motor car and the first of this model to be imported into Austria. It must have been 1907 or 1908.
I bought my first (second-hand) car in 1936 in London. I immediately drove it to Cambridge, and when I got out – on the right side, of course – I noticed that the rear wheel and its axle were protruding quite a bit from the car. As I recall, some thirty centimetres of axle could be seen, but my astonishment may well have coloured my memory. It was a ‘Standard’ sports car, a make that has long since disappeared – and rightly so.

Against the Cynical Interpretation of History*
In my long life I have never been bored – except at lectures, and especially those school lessons that produced a very painful numbing of the brain. I remember that the effect was particularly deadly in history and geography.
Perhaps it is forgivable, then, if many history teachers try to spice up their classes with a touch of cynicism. And it is understandable, though certainly not forgivable, if they go too far and make a cynical view of history the height of fashion.
The cynical interpretation states that, in history as well as more generally, greed is always in command – avarice, money-grubbing, gold, oil, and power. That, they say, is how it always has been and always will be, in despotic forms of rule but also in democracies, the only difference being that in the latter the hypocrisy is, if possible, even worse. I regard this theory as not only wrong but irresponsible, precisely because it has a ring of plausibility. I think there is an urgent need to combat it. For what we think about ourselves and our history is of some importance to us, important for our decisions and our actions. It is why I have chosen this topic today.

‘Waging Wars for Peace’*
Spiegel Herr Popper, the collapse of the Soviet Union has fulfilled a prophecy you made as much as half a century ago. Is this the triumph of critical rationalism over the enemies of the open society?
Popper I made no such prophecies, because I am of the view that no prophecies should be made. I think it is a completely wrong attitude to judge intellectuals by whether they make good prophecies.
The philosophy of history in Germany, at least since Hegel, has always thought it must somehow be prophetic. I think this is wrong. One learns from history, but history ends here and now. Our attitude to the future must be quite different from one of trying to extrapolate from history and, as it were, following the paths of history through into the future.

The Collapse of Communism Understanding the Past and Influencing the Future*
As you will have surmised from the title of my lecture, I am an opponent of Marxism. My lecture will be devoted to the Marxist attack upon our Western civilization, an attack that began with Lenin’s and Trotsky’s Revolution of October 1917 and of whose breakdown we meeting here today are the living witnesses.
Few of us here will be old enough to remember personally the beginning of all our troubles; but I am one of the few alive who vividly recall 28 June 1914, the day on which the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo. I can still hear the voice of the newspaper boy announcing that the assassin was a Serb (‘Der Täter ein Serbe!’). And I vividly remember the outbreak of the First World War on 28 July 1914 (my twelfth birthday). I learnt of the war in a letter from my father, and also from the large placard on which was printed a manifesto from Emperor Franz Joseph ‘To My Peoples’. I still remember the day in 1916 when I realized that Austria and Germany were going to lose the war they had started; I remember the days in March 1917 when a democratic revolution started in Russia; I remember Lenin’s putsch against the Kerensky government and the beginning of civil war in Russia; the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and the Russia of Lenin and Trotsky, in March 1918; and the collapse of the Austrian and German empires, which ended the war, in October 1918. These events were among the most important that I still vividly remember and, as I can now see, led all mankind close to its complete destruction.

The Necessity of Peace*
I thank you all, and especially the committee of the German Society for the United Nations, for the great honour I have been given today. That this honour is associated with the name of Otto Hahn has moved me most deeply.
Twenty years before he discovered the splitting of uranium, Otto Hahn was already one of my heroes – one of those great researchers in the fields of radiochemistry and atomic theory who discovered new radioactive elements, new atoms, and new forms of radiation. But they also invented new theories, important new hypothetical natural laws to describe and explain certain physical relationships between different forms of radiation, between the transformations of radioactive atoms.
Already in 1918, when I was sixteen years old, Otto Hahn figured as one of the real Greats, alongside Pierre and Marie Curie, Ernest Rutherford, William Ramsay, and the theorists Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr. It was at the Physics Institute on Boltzmanngasse in Vienna that I first heard of these great scientists, nuclear physicists and radiochemists, from my now long-dead friend Franz Urbach, who was working under Stefan Meyer at the Vienna Institute for Radio Research. A few years later, I read more about Otto Hahn in a textbook entitled Atomic Theory (first edition 1924) written by my teacher Arthur Haas, an important though today almost forgotten atomic scientist. I have looked up my well-thumbed copy of the second edition, dated 1929, and my memory was not wrong. On page 183 there is a sentence reporting both the discovery of radium and polonium by the Curies, and the discovery of protactinium by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.

Masaryk and the Open Society*
To be in Prague again after sixty years (and they have been difficult years for everybody): this is a great experience. I visited Prague from Vienna in 1912 and 1913, before the First World War, and also several times during the war. And it was at the latest in 1934 that I decided Prague was the most beautiful city in Central Europe. This has not changed. But everything else has.
Sixty years ago Tomás Garrigue Masaryk, the great founder of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and its liberator-president, was residing in the Hradschin Castle. I deeply admire Masaryk. He was one of the most important pioneers of what I called, a year or two after his death, the open society. He was a pioneer of an open society, both in theory and in practice – indeed, the greatest of its pioneers between Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill.

How I Became a Philosopher without Trying*
Dear President Inamori,
Esteemed Members of the Inamori Foundation,
Distinguished Guests,
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
May I begin by thanking all of you for coming here to listen to us, the Laureates of the Kyoto Prizes for 1992? You have come here to join us in celebrating what undoubtedly must be, for all three of us, one of the greatest and happiest occasions of our lives.
I understand that each of us is expected to give two lectures, of which today’s lecture is the first. While the second lecture is supposed to be of interest to the specialists in our respective fields of work, today’s lecture, as I understand it, should tell you something about our lives and how it happened that we devoted our interests and our ambitions to the special fields in which we did our main work.

The title of this lecture is likely, I fear, to offend some critical ears. For although ‘Sources of Knowledge’ is in order, and ‘Sources of Error’ would have been in order too, the phrase ‘Sources of Ignorance’ is another matter. ‘Ignorance is something negative: it is the absence of knowledge. But how on earth can the absence of anything have sources?’1 This question was put to me by a friend when I confided to him the title I had chosen for this lecture. Hard pressed for a reply I found myself improvising a rationalization, and explaining to my friend that the curious linguistic effect of the title was actually intended. I told him that I hoped to direct attention, through the phrasing of this title, to a number of unrecorded philosophical doctrines and among them (apart from the doctrine that truth is manifest) especially to the conspiracy theory of ignorance which interprets ignorance not as a mere lack of knowledge but as the work of some sinister power, the source of impure and evil influences which pervert and poison our minds and instil in us the habit of resistance to knowledge.

When I received the list of participants in this course and realized that I had been asked to speak to philosophical colleagues I thought, after some hesitation and consultation, that you would probably prefer me to speak about those problems which interest me most, and about those developments with which I am most intimately acquainted. I therefore decided to do what I have never done before: to give you a report on my own work in the philosophy of science, since the autumn of 1919 when I first began to grapple with the problem, ‘When should a theory be ranked as scientific?’ or ‘Is there a criterion for the scientific character or status of a theory?’

Section: 3
Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Section Title: 10Truth, Rationality, and the Growth of Scientific Knowledge - Ch010
Content:
My aim in this lecture is to stress the significance of one particular aspect of science—its need to grow, or, if you like, its need to progress. I do not have in mind here the practical or social significance of this need. What I wish to discuss is rather its intellectual significance. I assert that continued growth is essential to the rational and empirical character of scientific knowledge; that if science ceases to grow it must lose that character. It is the way of its growth which makes science rational and empirical; the way, that is, in which scientists discriminate between available theories and choose the better one or (in the absence of a satisfactory theory) the way they give reasons for rejecting all the available theories, thereby suggesting some of the conditions with which a satisfactory theory should comply.
You will have noticed from this formulation that it is not the accumulation of observations which I have in mind when I speak of the growth of scientific knowledge, but the repeated overthrow of scientific theories and their replacement by better or more satisfactory ones. This, incidentally, is a procedure which might be found worthy of attention even by those who see the most important aspect of the growth of scientific knowledge in new experiments and in new observations. For our critical examination of our theories leads us to attempts to test and to overthrow them; and these lead us further to experiments and observations of a kind which nobody would ever have dreamt of without the stimulus and guidance both of our theories and of our criticism of them. For indeed, the most interesting experiments and observations were carefully designed by us in order to test our theories, especially our new theories.

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Section Title: 11The Demarcation between Science and Metaphysics - Ch011
Content:
Put in a nut-shell, my thesis amounts to this. The repeated attempts made by Rudolf Carnap to show that the demarcation between science and metaphysics coincides with that between sense and nonsense have failed. The reason is that the positivistic concept of ‘meaning’ or ‘sense’ (or of verifiability, or of inductive confirmability, etc.) is inappropriate for achieving this demarcation—simply because metaphysics need not be meaningless even though it is not science. In all its variants demarcation by meaninglessness has tended to be at the same time too narrow and too wide: as against all intentions and all claims, it has tended to exclude scientific theories as meaningless, while failing to exclude even that part of metaphysics which is known as ‘rational theology’.
Writing about Carnap—and in criticism of Carnap—brings back to my mind the time when I first met him, at his Seminar, in 1928 or 1929. It brings back even more vividly a later occasion, in 1932, in the beautiful Tyrolese hills, when I had the opportunity of spending part of my holidays in prolonged critical discussions with Carnap and with Herbert Feigl, in the company of our wives. We had a happy time, with plenty of sunshine, and I think we all tremendously enjoyed these long and fascinating talks, interspersed with a little climbing but never interrupted by it. None of us will ever forget, I am sure, how Carnap once led us in a steep climb up a trackless hill, through a beautiful and almost impenetrable thicket of alpine rhododendrons; and how he led us, at the same time, through a beautiful and almost impenetrable thicket of arguments whose topic induced Feigl to christen our hill ‘Semantische Schnuppe’ (something like ‘Semantical Shooting Star’)— though several years had to elapse before Carnap, stimulated by Tarski’s criticism, discovered the track which led him from Logical Syntax to Semantics.1

A Restatement of Interactionism
This is a paper on the impossibility of a physicalistic causal theory of the human language.1
1.1 It is not a paper on linguistic analysis (the analysis of word-usages). For I completely reject the claim of certain language analysts that the source of philosophical difficulties is to be found in the misuse of language. No doubt some people talk nonsense, but I claim (a) that there does not exist a logical or language-analytical method of detecting philosophical nonsense (which, by the way, does not stop short of the ranks of logicians, language analysts and semanticists); (b) that the belief that such a method exists—the belief more especially that philosophical nonsense can be unmasked as due to what Russell might have called ‘type-mistakes’ and what nowadays are sometimes called ‘category-mistakes’—is the aftermath of a philosophy of language which has since turned out to be baseless.

Section Title: 13A Note on the Body-Mind Problem - Ch013
Content:
I am very grateful to Professor Wilfrid Sellars for bringing1 my paper ‘Language and the Body-Mind Problem’,2 to the attention of philosophers, and even more for his kindness in describing it as ‘challenging’, and as ‘telling, if uneven’. Of its unevenness nobody can be more aware than I. I think I am more sensitive to it than Andersen’s princess was to the pea. And although I am inclined to count its three leaves among my scanty laurels, I could not rest on them even if I wished to. But the small hard peas which bother me and keep me awake at night seem to have been well hidden, and in a spot far removed from Professor Sellars’ two largish lumps of stuffing which I believe are not at all hard to smooth out.
As to the first lump, Professor Sellars, after quoting me correctly at some length, proceeds to ‘focus attention’, as he puts it, ‘On the statement [Popper’s statement] quoted above, that “… if the two languages are not translatable, they deal with different sets of facts”.’ And Professor Sellars then goes on to say that a ‘fact’ may be either a ‘descriptive fact’ or else something like ‘the “fact” that we ought to fulfil our undertakings’, which I may be permitted to call a ‘quasi fact’. And he says that my argument would be valid if only it would contain ‘the premise that both languages in question have the business of describing’, i.e. of stating ‘descriptive facts’.

There is nothing so absurd or incredible that it has not been asserted by one philosopher or another.
DESCARTES
The above motto can be generalized. It applies not only to philosophers and philosophy, but throughout the realm of human thought and enterprise, to science, technology, engineering and politics. Indeed, the tendency to try anything once, suggested by the motto, can be discerned in a still wider realm—in the stupendous variety of forms and appearances which are produced by life on our planet.
Thus if we want to explain why human thought tends to try out every conceivable solution for any problem with which it is faced, then we can appeal to a highly general sort of regularity. The method by which a solution is approached is usually the same; it is the method of trial and error. This, fundamentally, is also the method used by living organisms in the process of adaptation. It is clear that the success of this method depends very largely on the number and variety of the trials: the more we try, the more likely it is that one of our attempts will be successful.

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Section Title: 16Prediction and Prophecy in the Social Sciences - Ch016
Content:
The topic of my address is ‘Prediction and Prophecy in the Social Sciences’. My intention is to criticize the doctrine that it is the task of the social sciences to propound historical prophecies, and that historical prophecies are needed if we wish to conduct politics in a rational way.1 I shall call this doctrine ‘historicism’. I consider historicism to be the relic of an ancient superstition, even though the people who believe in it are usually convinced that it is a very new, progressive, revolutionary, and scientific theory.
The tenets of historicism—that it is the task of the social sciences to propound historical prophecies, and that these historical prophecies are needed for any rational theory—are topical today because they form a very important part of that philosophy which likes to call itself by the name of ‘Scientific Socialism’ or ‘Marxism’. My analysis of the role of prediction and prophecy could therefore be described as a criticism of the historical method of Marxism. But in fact it does not confine itself to that economic variant of historicism which is known as Marxism, for it aims at criticizing the historicist doctrine in general. Nevertheless, I have decided to speak as if Marxism were my main or my only object of attack, since I wish to avoid the accusation that I am attacking Marxism surreptitiously under the name of ‘historicism’. But I should be glad if you would remember that whenever I mention Marxism, I always have in mind a number of other philosophies of history also; for I am trying to criticize a certain historical method which has been believed to be valid by many philosophers, ancient and modern, whose political views were very different from those of Marx.

Section Title: 17Public Opinion and Liberal Principles - Ch017
Content:
The following remarks were designed to provide material for debate at an international conference of liberals (in the English sense of this term: see the end of the Preface). My purpose was simply to lay the foundations for a good general discussion. Because I could assume liberal views in my audience I was largely concerned to challenge, rather than to endorse, popular assumptions favourable to these views.
We should beware of a number of myths concerning ‘public opinion’ which are often accepted uncritically.
There is, first, the classical myth, vox populi vox dei, which attributes to the voice of the people a kind of final authority and unlimited wisdom. Its modern equivalent is faith in the ultimate common-sense rightness of that mythical figure, ‘the man in the street’, his vote, and his voice. The avoidance of the plural in both cases is characteristic. Yet people are, thank God, seldom univocal; and the various men in the various streets are as different as any collection of V.I.P.s in a conference-room. And if, on occasion, they do speak more or less in unison, what they say is not necessarily wise. They may be right, or they may be wrong. ‘The voice’ may be very firm on very doubtful issues. (Example: the nearly unanimous and unquestioning acceptance of the demand for ‘unconditional surrender’.) And it may waver on issues over which there is hardly room for doubt. (Example: the question whether to condone political blackmail, and mass-murder.) It may be well-intentioned but imprudent. (Example: the public reaction which destroyed the Hoare-Laval plan.) Or it may be neither well-intentioned nor very prudent. (Example: the approval of the Runciman mission; the approval of the Munich agreement of 1938.)

Section Title: 18Utopia and Violence - Ch018
Content:
There are many people who hate violence and are convinced that it is one of their foremost and at the same time one of their most hopeful tasks to work for its reduction and, if possible, for its elimination from human life. I am among these hopeful enemies of violence. Not only do I hate violence, but I firmly believe that the fight against it is not at all hopeless. I realize that the task is difficult. I realize that, only too often in the course of history, it has happened that what appeared at first to be a great success in the fight against violence was followed by defeat. I do not overlook the fact that the new age of violence which was opened by the two World wars is by no means at an end. Nazism and Fascism are thoroughly beaten, but I must admit that their defeat does not mean that barbarism and brutality have been defeated. On the contrary, it is no use closing our eyes to the fact that these hateful ideas achieved something like victory in defeat. I have to admit that Hitler succeeded in degrading the moral standards of our Western world, and that in the world of today there is more violence and brutal force than would have been tolerated even in the decade after the first World war. And we must face the possibility that our civilization may ultimately be destroyed by those new weapons which Hitlerism wished upon us, perhaps even within the first decade1 after the second World war; for no doubt the spirit of Hitlerism won its greatest victory over us when, after its defeat, we used the weapons which the threat of Nazism had induced us to develop. But in spite of all this I am today no less hopeful than I have ever been that violence can be defeated. It is our only hope; and long stretches in the history of Western as well as of Eastern civilizations prove that it need not be a vain hope—that violence can be reduced, and brought under the control of reason.

Section Title: 19The History of our Time: An Optimist’s View - Ch019
Content:
In a series of lectures instituted to keep alive the memory of that inspired and successful social reformer, Eleanor Rathbone, it is perhaps not out of place to devote a lecture to a general though tentative assessment of the problem of social reform in our time. What have we achieved, if anything? How does our western society compare with others? These are the questions which I propose to discuss.
I have chosen as the title of my lecture ‘The History of Our Time: An Optimist’s View’, and I feel that I should begin by explaining this title.
When I say ‘History’, I wish to refer particularly to our social and political history, but also to our moral and intellectual history. By the word ‘our’, I mean the free world of the Atlantic Community— especially England, the United States, the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland, and the outposts of this world in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand. By ‘our time’ I mean, in particular, the period since 1914. But I also mean the last fifty or sixty years—that is to say the time since the Boer War, or the age of Winston Churchill, as one might call it; the last hundred years—that is, in the main, the time since the abolition of slavery and since John Stuart Mill; the last two hundred years—that is, in the main, the time since the American Revolution, since Hume, Voltaire, Kant, and Burke; and to a lesser extent, the last three hundred years—the time since the Reformation; since Locke, and since Newton. So much for the phrase ‘The History of Our Time’.

Section Title: 2The Nature of Philosophical Problems and their Roots in Science - Ch02
Content:
It was after some hesitation that I decided to take as my point of departure the present position of English philosophy. For I believe that the function of a scientist or of a philosopher is to solve scientific or philosophical problems, rather than to talk about what he or other philosophers are doing or might do. Any unsuccessful attempt to solve a scientific or philosophical problem, if it is an honest and devoted attempt, appears to me more significant than a discussion of such a question as ‘What is science?’ or ‘What is philosophy?’ And even if we put this latter question, as we should, in the slightly better form, ‘What is the character of philosophical problems?’, I for one should not bother much about it; I should feel that it had little weight, even compared with such a minor problem of philosophy as the question whether every discussion or every criticism must always proceed from ‘assumptions’ or ‘suppositions’ which themselves are beyond argument.1

Section Title: 20Humanism and Reason - Ch020
Content:
The first of a series of books, Studia Humanitatis, published in Switzerland, is written in German by two friends, Ernesto Grassi, an Italian scholar interested in the ‘Humanist’ writers of the Renaissance, and Thure von Uexküll, son of the German biologist Jakob von Uexküll, famous for his Theoretical Biology. The book1 which deals with The Origin and the Limits of the Moral and the Natural Sciences, is part of a movement of considerable interest that aims at re-awakening the spirit of the humanists. This neo-humanist movement is characteristically Central European, born of the disasters suffered by the Continent during this century; and although the book under review is not only scholarly but also serene, some of its moods, and some of the conclusions drawn, may not easily be appreciated by those who have no personal knowledge of the shattering experience of social disintegration through which it was the lot of these European thinkers to live. The neohumanist movement is inspired by the conviction (shared by a number of other movements) that it knows both the causes and the cure of the widespread depravity and perversion of everything human which Central Europe has had to witness. Its message is that only the understanding of man and his ‘essential nature’—his cultural creativity—can bring relief to our ills; and it tries, as is made clear by Grassi’s ‘Introductory Remark’, to take up again the task of developing a philosophy of man and of that important human activity, science. Science, according to this philosophy, is to be reinterpreted as a part of ‘humanism’; consequently a meaning of ‘humanism’ and of ‘humanistic’ which confines humanism to the ‘humanities’—that is, to historical, philological and literary studies—is rejected as too narrow.

Section Title: 3Three Views Concerning Human Knowledge - Ch03
Content:
Once upon a time there was a famous scientist whose name was Galileo Galilei. He was tried by the Inquisition, and forced to recant his teaching. This caused a great stir; and for well over two hundred and fifty years the case continued to arouse indignation and excitement— long after public opinion had won its victory, and the Church had become tolerant of science.
But this is by now a very old story, and I fear it has lost its interest. For Galilean science has no enemies left, it seems: its life hereafter is secure. The victory won long ago was final, and all is quiet on this front. So we take a detached view of the affair nowadays, having learned at last to think historically, and to understand both sides of a dispute. And nobody cares to listen to the bore who can’t forget an old grievance.
What, after all, was this old case about? It was about the status of the Copernican ‘System of the World’ which, besides other things, explained the diurnal motion of the sun as only apparent, and as due to the rotation of our own earth.1 The Church was very ready to admit that the new system was simpler than the old one: that it was a more convenient instrument for astronomical calculations, and for predictions. And Pope Gregory’s reform of the calendar made full practical use of it. There was no objection to Galileo’s teaching the mathematical theory, so long as he made it clear that its value was instrumental only; that it was nothing but a ‘supposition’, as Cardinal Bellarmino put it;2 or a ‘mathematical hypothesis’—a kind of mathematical trick, ‘invented and assumed in order to abbreviate and ease the calculations’.3 In other words there were no objections so long as Galileo was ready to fall into line with Andreas Osiander who had said in his preface to Copernicus’ De revolutionibus: ‘There is no need for these hypotheses to be true, or even to be at all like the truth; rather, one thing is sufficient for them— that they should yield calculations which agree with the observations.’

Section Title: 4Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition - Ch04
Content:
In the title of this talk the emphasis should be put on the word ‘towards’: I do not intend to put forward anything like a full theory. I want to explain to you and to illustrate the kind of question which a theory of tradition would have to answer, and to give in outline some ideas which may be useful for constructing it. By way of introduction I intend to say how I came to be interested in the subject, and why I think it is important; and I also intend to refer to some possible attitudes towards it.
I am a rationalist of sorts. I am not quite certain whether or not my rationalism will be acceptable to you, but that will be seen later. I am very interested in scientific method. Having studied for some time the methods of the natural sciences, I felt that it might be interesting to study also the methods of the social sciences. It was then that I first met with the problem of tradition. The anti-rationalists in the field of politics, social theory, and so on, usually suggest that this problem cannot be tackled by any kind of rational theory. Their attitude is to accept tradition as something just given. You have to take it; you cannot rationalize it; it plays an important role in society, and you can only understand its significance and accept it. The most important name associated with this anti-rationalist view is that of Edmund Burke. He fought, as you know, against the ideas of the French Revolution, and his most effective weapon was his analysis of the importance of that irrational power which we call ‘tradition’. I mention Burke because I think he has never been properly answered by rationalists. Instead rationalists tended to ignore his criticism and to persevere in their anti-traditionalist attitude without taking up the challenge. Undoubtedly there is a traditional hostility between rationalism and traditionalism. Rationalists are inclined to adopt the attitude: ‘I am not interested in tradition. I want to judge everything on its own merits; I want to find out its merits and demerits, and I want to do this quite independently of any tradition. I want to judge it with my own brain, and not with the brains of other people who lived long ago.’

Section Title: 5Back to the Presocratics - Ch05
Content:
‘Back to Methuselah’ was a progressive programme, compared with ‘Back to Thales’ or ‘Back to Anaximander’: what Shaw offered us was an improved expectation of life—something that was in the air, at any rate when he wrote it. I have nothing to offer you, I am afraid, that is in the air today; for what I want to return to is the simple straightforward rationality of the Presocratics. Wherein does this much discussed ‘rationality’ of the Presocratics lie? The simplicity and boldness of their questions is part of it, but my thesis is that the decisive point is the critical attitude which, as I shall try to show, was first developed in the Ionian School.
The questions which the Presocratics tried to answer were primarily cosmological questions, but there were also questions of the theory of knowledge. It is my belief that philosophy must return to cosmology and to a simple theory of knowledge. There is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested: the problem of understanding the world in which we live; and thus ourselves (who are part of that world) and the way we acquire our knowledge of it. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the interest of philosophy, no less than of science, lies solely in its bold attempt to add to our knowledge of the world, and to the theory of our knowledge of the world. I am interested in Wittgenstein, for example, not because of his linguistic philosophy, but because his Tractatus was a cosmological treatise (although a crude one), and because his theory of knowledge was closely linked with his cosmology.

Section Title: 6A Note on Berkeley as Precursor of Mach and Einstein - Ch06
Content:
I had only a very vague idea who Bishop Berkeley was, but was thankful to him for having defended us from an incontrovertible first premise.
SAMUEL BUTLER
In this short contribution to the 200th anniversary of Berkeley’s death, I wish to give a list of those ideas of Berkeley’s in the field of the philosophy of physics which have a strikingly new look. They are mainly ideas which were rediscovered and reintroduced into the discussion of modern physics by Ernst Mach and Heinrich Hertz, and by a number of philosophers and physicists, some of them influenced by Mach, such as Bertrand Russell, Philip Frank, Richard von Mises, Moritz Schlick,1 Werner Heisenberg and others.
I may say at once that I do not agree with most of these positivistic views. I admire Berkeley without agreeing with him. But criticism of Berkeley is not the purpose of this note, and will be confined to some very brief and incomplete remarks in section v.2

Section Title: 7Kant’s Critique and Cosmology - Ch07
Content:
One hundred and fifty years ago Immanuel Kant died, having spent the eighty years of his life in the Prussian provincial town of Königsberg. For years his retirement had been complete,1 and his friends intended a quiet burial. But this son of an artisan was buried like a king. When the rumour of his death spread through the town the people flocked to his house demanding to see him. On the day of the funeral the life of the town was at a standstill. The coffin was followed by thousands, while the bells of all the churches tolled. Nothing like this had ever before happened in Königsberg, say the chroniclers.2
It is difficult to account for this astonishing upsurge of popular feeling. Was it due solely to Kant’s reputation as a great philosopher and a good man? It seems to me that there was more in it than this; and I suggest that in the year 1804, under the absolute monarchy of Frederick William, those bells tolling for Kant carried an echo of the American and French revolutions—of the ideas of 1776 and 1789. I suggest that to his countrymen Kant had become an embodiment of these ideas.3 They came to show their gratitude to a teacher of the Rights of Man, of equality before the law, of world citizenship, of peace on earth, and, perhaps most important, of emancipation through knowledge.4

Section Title: 8On the Status of Science and of Metaphysics - Ch08
Content:
In this talk I do not propose to speak of ordinary everyday experience. I intend, rather, to use the word ‘experience’ in the sense in which we use it when we say that science is based on experience. Since, however, experience in science is after all no more than an extension of ordinary everyday experience what I shall have to say will apply, by and large, to everyday experience also.
In order not to get lost in abstractions I intend to discuss the logical status of a specific empirical science—Newtonian dynamics. I do not, however, presuppose any knowledge of physics on the part of my audience.
One of the things a philosopher may do, and one of those that may rank among his highest achievements, is to see a riddle, a problem, or a paradox, not previously seen by anyone else. This is an even greater achievement than resolving the riddle. The philosopher who first sees and understands a new problem disturbs our laziness and complacency. He does to us what Hume did for Kant: he rouses us from our ‘dogmatic slumber’. He opens out a new horizon before us.

Section Title: 9Why are the Calculi of Logic and Arithmetic Applicable to Reality? - Ch09
Content:
Professor Ryle has confined his contribution1 to the applicability of the rules of logic, or more precisely, to the logical rules of inference. I intend to follow him in this, and only later to extend the discussion to the applicability of logical and arithmetical calculi. The distinction I have just made between the logical rules of inference and the so-called logical calculi (such as the propositional calculus or the class calculus or the calculus of relations) needs, however, some clarification, and I shall discuss the distinction, as well as the connection between the rules of inference and the calculi, in section i, before taking up the two main problems before us: that of the applicability of the rules of inference (in section ii), and that of the applicability of the logical calculi (in section viii).
I shall allude to, and make use of, some ideas from Professor Ryle’s paper, and also from his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society, Knowing How and Knowing That (1945).2

Book Title: Conjectures and Refutations
Section Title: PREFACE - fm-Ch03
Content:
The essays and lectures of which this book is composed are variations upon one very simple theme—the thesis that we can learn from our mistakes. They develop a theory of knowledge and of its growth. It is a theory of reason that assigns to rational arguments the modest and yet important role of criticizing our often mistaken attempts to solve our problems. And it is a theory of experience that assigns to our observations the equally modest and almost equally important role of tests which may help us in the discovery of our mistakes. Though it stresses our fallibility it does not resign itself to scepticism, for it also stresses the fact that knowledge can grow, and that science can progress—just because we can learn from our mistakes.
The way in which knowledge progresses, and especially our scientific knowledge, is by unjustified (and unjustifiable) anticipations, by guesses, by tentative solutions to our problems, by conjectures. These conjectures are controlled by criticism; that is, by attempted refutations, which include severely critical tests. They may survive these tests; but they can never be positively justified: they can be established neither as certainly true nor even as ‘probable’ (in the sense of the probability calculus). Criticism of our conjectures is of decisive importance: by bringing out our mistakes it makes us understand the difficulties of the problem which we are trying to solve. This is how we become better acquainted with our problem, and able to propose more mature solutions: the very refutation of a theory—that is, of any serious tentative solution to our problem—is always a step forward that takes us nearer to the truth. And this is how we can learn from our mistakes.

Section Title: Addenda some Technical Notes - sec0003
Content:
We arrive at the idea of empirical content as follows. By the logical content (or the consequence class) of a we mean the class of all statements which follow from a. Thus we may first, and tentatively, consider calling the empirical content of a the class of all observational statements (or ‘basic statements’, see below) which follow from a.
But this tentative idea does not work. For what interests us most is the empirical content of an explanatory universal theory; yet from such a theory alone no observational statement follows. (From ‘All ravens are black’ we cannot derive any observational statement like ‘There is a black raven here now’; although we can indeed derive the statement ‘There is no white raven here now’.)
This is the reason why, in defining empirical content, I fell back on the idea that a theory tells us the more about observable facts the more such facts it forbids—that is to say, the more observable facts are incompatible with it.1 We then can say that the empirical content of a theory is determined by (and equal to) the class of those observational statements, or basic statements, which contradict the theory.

A Summary by Way of a Preface
All things living are in search of a better world.
Men, animals, plants, even unicellular organisms are constantly active. They are trying to improve their situation, or at least to avoid its deterioration. Even when asleep, the organism is actively maintaining the state of sleep: the depth (or else the shallowness) of sleep is a condition actively created by the organism, which sustains sleep (or else keeps the organism on the alert). Every organism is constantly preoccupied with the task of solving problems. These problems arise from its own assessments of its condition and of its environment; conditions which the organism seeks to improve.
An attempted solution often proves to be misguided, in that it makes things worse. Then follow further attempts at solutions – further trial and error movements.
We can see that life – even at the level of the unicellular organism – brings something completely new into the world, something that did not previously exist: problems and active attempts to solve them; assessments, values; trial and error.

Knowledge and the Shaping of Reality
The Search for a Better World
The first half of the title of my lecture was not chosen by me, but by the organizers of the Alpbach Forum. Their title was: ‘Knowledge and the Shaping of Reality’.
My lecture consists of three parts: knowledge; reality; and the shaping of reality through knowledge. The second part, which deals with reality, is by far the longest, since it contains a great deal by way of preparation for the third part.
1. Knowledge
I shall start with knowledge. We live in a time in which irrational-ism has once more become fashionable. Consequently, I want to begin by declaring that I regard scientific knowledge as the best and most important kind of knowledge we have – though I am far from regarding it as the only one. The central features of scientific knowledge are as follows:

On Knowledge and Ignorance
Mr President, Mr Dean, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University for the great honour they have bestowed on me in making me a doctor rerum politicarum honoris causa. With Johann Wolfgang Goethe’s great first monologue of Doctor Faust, I can now say:
They call me a master, and a doctor to boot …
But in teaching my students I can do no good.
But I really must ask you for your permission to recite a dozen lines or so from the beginning of the monologue in full; you will find that they are highly relevant.1
I have studied philosophy

On the So-Called Sources of Knowledge
Thank you for the great honour that you have bestowed on me by making me a Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Arts of your University. I am deeply grateful for this honour and I accept it with real pleasure.
I have also taken on a difficult task, at very short notice, namely the task of giving a short lecture. Before I begin this lecture, however, I should like to tell you a true story from my days in New Zealand.
In Christchurch, New Zealand, I was friendly with the physicist Professor Coleridge Farr, who was roughly the same age when I arrived there as I am now. He was a very witty and amusing man and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. Professor Farr was a public-spirited man, and used to give lectures on popular science in the most varied circles, including, among others, prisons. Once he began his lecture in a prison with the words: ‘Today I am giving exactly the same lecture as I gave here six years ago. So if anyone has already heard it, then it jolly well serves him right!’ Scarcely had he uttered these rather provocative words, when the light in the lecture hall went out. He said afterwards that he had felt rather ill at ease until the light came back on.

Science and Criticism
As an old member of the Alpbach Forum I was very pleased to be invited to its thirtieth birthday celebrations; but I only accepted this invitation after some hesitation. I thought it scarcely possible to say something sensible and comprehensible on our extremely wide-ranging basic theme of ‘Intellectual and scientific development over the past thirty years’ in just thirty minutes. In fact, if my mathematics are correct, this leaves me with exactly one minute for each year of intellectual and scientific development! And so I must not fritter away the time available to me with apologies, but must begin without further ado.
I
As you can see from die title I have chosen, ‘Science and Criticism’, I intend to let the question of intellectual development go more or less by the board and to deal mainly with the development of science. The reason for this is, quite simply, that I do not think much of the intellectual or cultural development of die past thirty years.

The Logic of the Social Sciences
I propose to begin my paper on the logic of the social sciences with two theses which express the contrast between our knowledge and our ignorance.
First thesis: We have a fair amount of knowledge. Moreover, we know not only details of doubtful intellectual interest, but also, and more especially, things that are not only of considerable practical importance, but may, in addition, provide us with deep theoretical insight, and with a surprising understanding of the world.
Second thesis: Our ignorance is boundless and sobering. Indeed, it is precisely this overwhelming progress of the natural sciences (to which my first thesis alludes) that continually reminds us of our ignorance, even in the field of the natural sciences themselves.
This gives a new twist to the Socratic idea of ignorance. With each step forward, with every problem we solve, we not only discover new and unsolved problems, but we also discover that just when we believed that we were standing on firm and safe ground, all things are, in reality, insecure and unstable.

Against Big Words
(A Letter not Originally Intended for Publication)
Preface. About fourteen years ago I received a letter from a Herr Klaus Grossner, whom I had never previously heard of. He mentioned my friend Hans Albert and asked me for a written interview about the state of (German) philosophy. I agreed with a great deal of his letter, and although I disagreed with some of it, I nevertheless thought it worthy of discussion; and so I answered his questions in spite of some reservations. In a subsequent letter, Herr Grossner asked me for permission to publish the parts of the letter printed here below in a book he was planning. Despite further misgivings I gave him my permission, but only for his book: I retained all my author’s rights, and stressed that my contribution to his book must not be reprinted without my express permission. Yet shortly afterwards an excerpt appeared (under the excellent title ‘Against Big Words’ [’Wider die groβen Worte’]) in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, without my permission and with no mention of my rights. (In Germany and Austria copyright is often considerably abused.) Since my letter has already been printed twice in excerpts and has been misquoted on many occasions, I have decided to reprint the previously published section here without any amendments, in spite of its aggressiveness. I wrote:

Books and Thoughts
Europe’s First Publication
I am grateful for the invitation to give a lecture about books. This is not only because I think that books, and therefore libraries, are the most characteristic and the most important physical things in our European civilization, and perhaps in human civilization as a whole, but also because of the dominating role books have played – and still play – in my own life. When I was five years old, the first volume of Selma Lagerlöf’s book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (Wunderbare Reise des kleinen Nils Holgersson mit den Wildgdnsen) was read to me. The work had just been published in three green volumes. No other book had such a decisive influence not only on my own character, but also on that of my childhood friend Konrad Lorenz. Konrad fell in love with the wild geese, whilst I fell in love with Selma Lagerlof and her books. Like her I became a school teacher. Both Konrad and I remained true to our loves.

On Culture Clash
I was very pleased to be invited to Vienna to see old friends again and to make new friends; and I felt it as a great honour to be invited here today by the Chairman of the Society of Expatriate Austrians to give a short lecture. His invitation stressed that the subject of my lecture was left to me. So he left to me, very kindly, all the agonies of having to make a choice.
The difficulties in making a decision were considerable. Obviously, I wished to choose a subject that interests me. On the other hand it should also have some relevance to the present occasion – to the meeting of expatriate Austrians in Vienna on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the Austrian State Treaty – the unique event that terminated the occupation of Austria after the Second World War.
I doubt if the subject I have chosen fulfils these expectations. Remembering the Austrian State Treaty and the Russian occupation of Austria that followed the Second World War, my talk is dedicated to the problem of culture clash – a thing that all expatriates must experience.

Immanuel Kant: The Philosopher of the Enlightenment
A Lecture to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Kant’s Death
One hundred and fifty years ago Immanuel Kant died, having spent the eighty years of his life in the Prussian provincial town of Konigsberg. For years his retirement had been complete,1 and his friends intended a quiet burial. But this son of an artisan was buried like a king. When the rumour of his death spread through the town the people flocked to his house demanding to see him. On the day of the funeral the life of the town was at a standstill.

Emancipation through Knowledge
The philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and with it his philosophy of history, is often looked upon in Germany as antiquated, and as superseded by Hegel and his followers. This may well be due to the surpassing intellectual and moral stature of Kant, Germany’s greatest philosopher; for the very greatness of his achievement was a thorn in the flesh of his lesser successors, so that Fichte, and later Hegel, tried to solve this irritating problem by persuading the world that Kant had been merely one of their forerunners. But Kant was nothing of the sort. On the contrary he was a determined opponent of the whole Romantic Movement and especially of Fichte: Kant was in fact the last great exponent of that much reviled movement, the Enlightenment. In an important essay entitled ‘What is Enlightenment?’ (1785) Kant wrote:
Enlightenment is the emancipation of man from a state of self-imposed tutelage. This state is due to his incapacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance. Such a state of tutelage I call ‘self-imposed’ [or ‘culpable’] if it is due not to lack of intelligence but to lack of courage or determination to use one’s own intelligence without the help of a leader. Sapere aude! Dare to use your own intelligence! This is the battle-cry of the Enlightenment.

Public Opinion and Liberal Principles
The following remarks were designed to provide material for debate at an international conference of liberals (in the English sense of the term1). My purpose was simply to lay the foundations for a good general discussion. Because I could assume liberal views in my audience I was largely concerned to challenge, rather than to endorse, popular assumptions favourable to these views.
I. The Myth of Public Opinion
We should beware of a number of myths concerning ‘public opinion’ which are often accepted uncritically.
There is, first, the classical myth, vox populi vox dei, which attributes to the voice of the people a kind of final authority and unlimited wisdom. Its modern equivalent is faith in the ultimate commonsense rightness of that mythical figure, ‘the man in the street’, his vote, and his voice. The avoidance of the plural in both cases is characteristic. Yet people are, thank God, seldom univocal; and the various men in the various streets are as different as any collection of VIPs in a conference-room. And if, on occasion, they do speak more or less in unison, what they say is not necessarily wise. They may be right, or they may be wrong. ‘The voice’ may be very firm on very doubtful issues. (Example: the nearly unanimous and unquestioning acceptance of the demand for ‘unconditional surrender’.) And it may waver on issues over which there is hardly room for doubt. (Example: the question whether to condone political blackmail, and mass-murder.) It may be well-intentioned but imprudent. (Example: the public reaction which destroyed the Hoare–Laval plan.) Or it may be neither well-intentioned nor very prudent. (Example: the approval of the Runciman mission; the approval of the Munich agreement of 1938.)

An Objective Theory of Historical Understanding
The different western philosophies are very largely variations on the theme of body–mind dualism. The main departures from this dualistic theme were attempts to replace it by some kind of monism. It seems to me that these attempts were unsuccessful. We find time and again that behind the veil of monistic protestations there still lurks the dualism of body and mind.
Pluralism and World 3
There were, however, not only monistic deviations, but also some pluralistic ones. This is obvious in polytheism, and even in its monotheistic and atheistic variants. Yet it may seem doubtful whether the various religious interpretations of the world offer an alternative to the dualism of body and mind, for the gods, whether many or few, are either minds endowed with immortal bodies, or else pure minds, in contrast to ourselves.

How I See Philosophy
(Stolen from Fritz Waismann and from One of the First Men to Land on the Moon)
I
A famous and spirited paper by my late friend Friedrich Waismann bears the title ‘How I See Philosophy’.1 There is much in this paper that I admire; and there are a number of points in it with which I can agree, even though my approach is totally different from his.
Fritz Waismann and many of his colleagues take it for granted that philosophers are a special kind of people and that philosophy can be looked upon as their peculiar activity. And what he tries to do in his paper is to show, with the help of examples, what constitutes the distinctive character of a philosopher, and the distinctive character of philosophy, if compared with other academic subjects such as mathematics or physics. Thus he tries, especially, to give a description of the interests and activities of contemporary academic philosophers, and of the sense in which they can be said to carry on what philosophers did in the past.

Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility
(Stolen from Xenophanes and Voltaire)
I have been asked here today to repeat a lecture which I gave in Tubingen, on the theme ‘Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility’. The lecture is dedicated to the memory of Leopold Lucas, a scholar, a historian, a man of toleration and humanity who became a victim of intolerance and inhumanity.
At the age of seventy, in December 1942, Dr Leopold Lucas and his wife were imprisoned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he worked as a rabbi: an immensely difficult task. He died there ten months later. Dora Lucas, his wife, was kept in Theresienstadt for another thirteen months, but she was able to work as a nurse. In October 1944 she was deported to Poland, together with 18,000 other prisoners. There she was put to death.
It was a terrible fate. It was the fate of countless human beings; people who loved other people, who tried to help other people; who were loved by other people and whom other people tried to help. They belonged to families which were torn apart, destroyed, exterminated.

What Does the West Believe in?
(Stolen from the Author of The Open Society)
I am sorry to say that I must begin with an apology: an apology for the title of my lecture. This title reads: ‘What Does the West Believe In?’ When I think of the history of the expression ‘the West’, I wonder whether I should not have avoided it. This expression has gained currency in England primarily through the translation of Spengler’s Untergang des Abendlandes, for the English title of this book is The Decline of the West. Yet I do not, of course, want to associate myself with Spengler, whom I regard not only as a false prophet of an alleged decline, but also as a symptom of a real decline, even though this is not a decline of the West: what his prophecies actually illustrate is the decline of the intellectual conscience of many western thinkers. They illustrate the victory of intellectual immodesty, of the attempt to beguile a public that is thirsty for knowledge by using bombastic words, in short, the victory of Hegelianism and of that Hegelian historicism which Schopenhauer exposed as the intellectual plague of Germany more than a century ago and against which he fought.

Creative Self-Criticism in Science and in Art
(Stolen from Beethoven’s Sketch Books)
I should like first of all to express my thanks for the kind invitation to give the opening address at the Salzburg Festival. This is a great honour. The invitation came as a complete surprise, and it was even somewhat disturbing. Ever since 1950 my wife and I have led a secluded life in our house in the Chiltern Hills. We have no television and no newspaper, and we are completely absorbed by our work. My work is concerned mainly with an abstract subject: the problem of human knowledge and, in particular, of scientific knowledge. That hardly qualifies me to give an opening address at the Salzburg Festival.
So I wondered why I had been invited. First I thought that I had been confused with somebody else. Or was it perhaps because of my love for this city, which sprang from a childhood love, when I was about 5 or 6 years old, well over 70 years ago? Yet no one knew of this. And nobody knew about an adventure I had here on an icy cold night, more than half a century ago. It was midnight, and I was on my way home from skiing, when, in the beautiful light of a full moon, I happened to slip into one of Salzburg’s two famous horseponds … Indeed there must have been other reasons for choosing me as your guest speaker. Then something occurred to me. In one respect I am really quite unique: you see, I am an optimist. I am an optimist in a world where among the intelligentsia it has become a strict rule that one must be a pessimist if one wants to be ‘in’. But I do believe that our age is not so bad as is generally maintained. I do believe that it is better and more beautiful than its reputation. A quarter of a century ago, I gave a lecture, the title of which sounds today even more provocative than it did then: ‘The History of our Time: An Optimist’s View’.1 So if there is anything that qualifies me to give this address, then it is perhaps the reputation of being an incorrigible optimist.

Section Title: PREFACE TO THE FIRST ENGLISH EDITION, 1959 - c_d1e117
Content:
In my old preface of 1934 I tried to explain—too briefly, I am afraid— my attitude towards the then prevailing situation in philosophy, and especially towards linguistic philosophy and the school of language analysts of those days. In this new preface I intend to explain my attitude towards the present situation, and towards the two main schools of language analysts of today. Now as then, language analysts are important to me; not only as opponents, but also as allies, in so far as they seem to be almost the only philosophers left who keep alive some of the traditions of rational philosophy.
Language analysts believe that there are no genuine philosophical problems, or that the problems of philosophy, if any, are problems of linguistic usage, or of the meaning of words. I, however, believe that there is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested. It is the problem of cosmology: the problem of understanding the world—including ourselves, and our knowledge, as part of the world. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the interest of philosophy, no less than of science, lies solely in the contributions which it has made to it. For me, at any rate, both philosophy and science would lose all their attraction if they were to give up that pursuit. Admittedly, understanding the functions of our language is an important part of it; but explaining away our problems as merely linguistic ‘puzzles’ is not.

Section Title: 1 A SURVEY OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS - c_d1e349
Content:
A scientist, whether theorist or experimenter, puts forward statements, or systems of statements, and tests them step by step. In the field of the empirical sciences, more particularly, he constructs hypotheses, or systems of theories, and tests them against experience by observation and experiment.
I suggest that it is the task of the logic of scientific discovery, or the logic of knowledge, to give a logical analysis of this procedure; that is, to analyse the method of the empirical sciences.
But what are these ‘methods of the empirical sciences’? And what do we call ‘empirical science’?
According to a widely accepted view—to be opposed in this book — the empirical sciences can be characterized by the fact that they use ‘inductive methods’, as they are called. According to this view, the logic of scientific discovery would be identical with inductive logic, i.e. with the logical analysis of these inductive methods.

Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: 2 ON THE PROBLEM OF A THEORY OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD - c_d1e1709
Content:
In accordance with my proposal made above, epistemology, or the logic of scientific discovery, should be identified with the theory of scientific method. The theory of method, in so far as it goes beyond the purely logical analysis of the relations between scientific statements, is concerned with the choice of methods—with decisions about the way in which scientific statements are to be dealt with. These decisions will of course depend in their turn upon the aim which we choose from among a number of possible aims. The decision here proposed for laying down suitable rules for what I call the ‘empirical method’ is closely connected with my criterion of demarcation: I propose to adopt such rules as will ensure the testability of scientific statements; which is to say, their falsifiability.
What are rules of scientific method, and why do we need them? Can there be a theory of such rules, a methodology?
The way in which one answers these questions will largely depend upon one’s attitude to science. Those who, like the positivists, see empirical science as a system of statements which satisfy certain logical criteria, such as meaningfulness or verifiability, will give one answer. A very different answer will be given by those who tend to see (as I do) the distinguishing characteristic of empirical statements in their susceptibility to revision—in the fact that they can be criticized, and superseded by better ones; and who regard it as their task to analyse the characteristic ability of science to advance, and the characteristic manner in which a choice is made, in crucial cases, between conflicting systems of theories.

Section: 4
Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: 3 THEORIES - c_d1e2100
Content:
The empirical sciences are systems of theories. The logic of scientific knowledge can therefore be described as a theory of theories.
Scientific theories are universal statements. Like all linguistic representations they are systems of signs or symbols. Thus I do not think it helpful to express the difference between universal theories and singular statements by saying that the latter are ‘concrete’ whereas theories are merely symbolic formulae or symbolic schemata; for exactly the same may be said of even the most ‘concrete’ statements.*1
Theories are nets cast to catch what we call ‘the world’: to rationalize, to explain, and to master it. We endeavour to make the mesh ever finer and finer.
To give a causal explanation of an event means to deduce a statement which describes it, using as premises of the deduction one or more universal laws, together with certain singular statements, the initial conditions. For example, we can say that we have given a causal explanation of the breaking of a certain piece of thread if we have found that the thread has a tensile strength of 1 lb. and that a weight of 2 lbs. was put on it. If we analyse this causal explanation we shall find several constituent parts. On the one hand there is the hypothesis: ‘Whenever a thread is loaded with a weight exceeding that which characterizes the tensile strength of the thread, then it will break’; a statement which has the character of a universal law of nature. On the other hand we have singular statements (in this case two) which apply only to the specific event in question: ‘The weight characteristic for this thread is 1 lb.’, and ‘The weight put on this thread was 2 lbs.’*1

Section Title: 4 FALSIFIABILITY - c_d1e3272
Content:
The question whether there is such a thing as a falsifiable singular statement (or a ‘basic statement’) will be examined later. Here I shall assume a positive answer to this question; and I shall examine how far my criterion of demarcation is applicable to theoretical systems—if it is applicable at all. A critical discussion of a position usually called ‘conventionalism’ will raise first some problems of method, to be met by taking certain methodological decisions. Next I shall try to characterize the logical properties of those systems of theories which are falsifiable— falsifiable, that is, if our methodological proposals are adopted.
Objections are bound to be raised against my proposal to adopt falsifiability as our criterion for deciding whether or not a theoretical system belongs to empirical science. They will be raised, for example, by those who are influenced by the school of thought known as ‘conventionalism’. 1 Some of these objections have already been touched upon in sections 6, 11, and 17; they will now be considered a little more closely.

Section: 6
Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: 5 THE PROBLEM OF THE EMPIRICAL BASIS - c_d1e4230
Content:
We have now reduced the question of the falsifiability of theories to that of the falsifiability of those singular statements which I have called basic statements. But what kind of singular statements are these basic statements? How can they be falsified? To the practical research worker, these questions may be of little concern. But the obscurities and misunderstandings which surround the problem make it advisable to discuss it here in some detail.
The doctrine that the empirical sciences are reducible to senseperceptions, and thus to our experiences, is one which many accept as obvious beyond all question. However, this doctrine stands or falls with inductive logic, and is here rejected along with it. I do not wish to deny that there is a grain of truth in the view that mathematics and logic are based on thinking, and the factual sciences on sense-perceptions. But what is true in this view has little bearing on the epistemological problem. And indeed, there is hardly a problem in epistemology which has suffered more severely from the confusion of psychology with logic than this problem of the basis of statements of experience.

Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: 6DEGREES OF TESTABILITY - c_d1e5492
Content:
Theories may be more, or less, severely testable; that is to say, more, or less, easily falsifiable. The degree of their testability is of significance for the selection of theories.
In this chapter, I shall compare the various degrees of testability or falsifiability of theories through comparing the classes of their potential falsifiers. This investigation is quite independent of the question whether or not it is possible to distinguish in an absolute sense between falsifiable and non-falsifiable theories. Indeed one might say of the present chapter that it ‘relativizes’ the requirement of falsifiability by showing falsifiability to be a matter of degree.
A theory is falsifiable, as we saw in section 23, if there exists at least one non-empty class of homotypic basic statements which are forbidden by it; that is, if the class of its potential falsifiers is not empty. If, as in section 23, we represent the class of all possible basic statements by a circular area, and the possible events by the radii of the circle, then we can say: At least one radius—or perhaps better, one narrow sector whose width may represent the fact that the event is to be ‘observable’—must be incompatible with the theory and ruled out by it. One might then represent the potential falsifiers of various theories by sectors of various widths. And according to the greater and lesser width of the sectors ruled out by them, theories might then be said to have more, or fewer, potential falsifiers. (The question whether this ‘more’ or ‘fewer’ could be made at all precise will be left open for the moment.) It might then be said, further, that if the class of potential falsifiers of one theory is ‘larger’ than that of another, there will be more opportunities for the first theory to be refuted by experience; thus compared with the second theory, the first theory may be said to be ‘falsifiable in a higher degree’. This also means that the first theory says more about the world of experience than the second theory, for it rules out a larger class of basic statements. Although the class of permitted statements will thereby become smaller, this does not affect our argument; for we have seen that the theory does not assert anything about this class. Thus it can be said that the amount of empirical information conveyed by a theory, or its empirical content, increases with its degree of falsifiability.

Section Title: 7 SIMPLICITY - c_d1e7555
Content:
There seems to be little agreement as to the importance of the so-called ‘problem of simplicity’. Weyl said, not long ago, that ‘the problem of simplicity is of central importance for the epistemology of the natural sciences’.1 Yet it seems that interest in the problem has lately declined; perhaps because, especially after Weyl’s penetrating analysis, there seemed to be so little chance of solving it.
Until quite recently the idea of simplicity has been used uncritically, as though it were quite obvious what simplicity is, and why it should be valuable. Not a few philosophers of science have given the concept of simplicity a place of crucial importance in their theories, without even noticing the difficulties to which it gives rise. For example, the followers of Mach, Kirchhoff, and Avenarius have tried to replace the idea of a causal explanation by that of the ‘simplest description’. Without the adjective ‘simplest’ or a similar word this doctrine would say nothing. As it is supposed to explain why we prefer a description of the world with the help of theories to one with the help of singular statements, it seems to presuppose that theories are simpler than singular statements. Yet few have ever attempted to explain why they should be simpler, or what is meant, more precisely, by simplicity.

Section Title: 8 PROBABILITY - c_d1e11895
Content:
In this chapter I shall only deal with the probability of events and the problems it raises. They arise in connection with the theory of games of chance, and with the probabilistic laws of physics. I shall leave the problems of what may be called the probability of hypotheses—such questions as whether a frequently tested hypothesis is more probable than one which has been little tested—to be discussed in sections 79 to 85 under the title of ‘Corroboration’.
Ideas involving the theory of probability play a decisive part in modern physics. Yet we still lack a satisfactory, consistent definition of probability; or, what amounts to much the same, we still lack a satisfactory axiomatic system for the calculus of probability. The relations between probability and experience are also still in need of clarification. In investigating this problem we shall discover what will at first seem an almost insuperable objection to my methodological views. For although probability statements play such a vitally important rôle in empirical science, they turn out to be in principle impervious to strict falsification. Yet this very stumbling block will become a touchstone upon which to test my theory, in order to find out what it is worth.

Section Title: 9 SOME OBSERVATIONS ON QUANTUM THEORY - c_d1e14054
Content:
Our analysis of the problem of probability has placed instruments at our disposal which we may now put to the test, by applying them to one of the topical problems of modern science; and I will try, with their help, to analyse, and to clarify, some of the more obscure points of modern quantum theory.
My somewhat audacious attempt to tackle, by philosophical or logical methods, one of the central problems of physics, is bound to arouse the suspicion of the physicist. I admit that his scepticism is healthy and his suspicions well-founded; yet I have some hope that I may be able to overcome them. Meanwhile it is worth remembering that in every branch of science, questions may crop up which are mainly logical. It is a fact that quantum physicists have been eagerly participating in epistemological discussions. This may suggest that they themselves feel that the solution of some of the still unsolved problems in quantum theory has to be sought in the no-man’s-land that lies between logic and physics.

Section Title: 10 CORROBORATION, OR HOW A THEORY STANDS UP TO TESTS - c_d1e16130
Content:
Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable. Inductive logic, more especially, has been developed as a logic which may ascribe not only the two values ‘true’ and ‘false’ to statements, but also degrees of probability; a type of logic which will here be called ‘probability logic’. According to those who believe in probability logic, induction should determine the degree of probability of a statement. And a principle of induction should either make it sure that the induced statement is ‘probably valid’ or else it should make it probable, in its turn—for the principle of induction might itself be only ‘probably valid’. Yet in my view, the whole problem of the probability of hypotheses is misconceived. Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1

Section Title: APPENDIX i Definition of the Dimension of a Theory (cf. sections 38 and 39) - c_d1e18325
Content:
The definition which follows here should be regarded as only provisional.*1 It is an attempt to define the dimension of a theory so as to make it agree with the dimension of the set of curves which results if the field of application of the theory is represented by a graph paper. A difficulty arises from the fact that we should not assume that either a metric or even a topology is defined for the field, to begin with; in particular, we should not assume that any neighbourhood relations are defined. And I admit that this difficulty is circumvented rather than overcome by the definition proposed. The possibility of circumventing it is connected with the fact that a theory always prohibits some ‘homotypic’ events, as we have called them (i.e. a class of occurrences which differ only in their spatio-temporal co-ordinates; cf. sections 23 and 31). For this reason, spatio-temporal co-ordinates will, in general, appear in the schema which generates the field of application, and consequently the field of the relatively atomic statements will, in general, show a topological and even a metrical order.

Section Title: APPENDIX ii The General Calculus of Frequency in Finite Classes (cf. sections 52 and 53)*1 - c_d1e18563
Content:
The General Multiplication Theorem: We denote the finite reference class by ‘α’, and the two property classes by ‘β’ and ‘γ’. Our first problem is to determine the frequency of those elements which belong both to β and to γ.
The solution is given by the formula
(1)
or, since β and γ may be commuted:

The proof results immediately from the definition given in section 52. From (1) we obtain, by substitution in accordance with this definition:
(1,1)
which proves to be an identity after cancellation of ‘N(α.β)’. (Contrast with this proof, and with the proof of (2s), by Reichenbach in Mathematische Zeitschrift 34, p. 593.)

where ‘σm’ denotes one particular n-tuple (although an arbitrarily chosen one) which contains m ones. (The symbol is intended to indicate that what is given is the complete arrangement of this n-tuple, i.e. not only the number of ones but also their positions in the n-tuple.) For assume that (2) holds for all n, m and σ (i.e. the various arrangements of the ones). Then there will be, according to a well-known combinatorial theorem,nCm distinct ways of distributing m ones in n places; and in view of the special addition theorem, we could then assert (1).

Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: APPENDIX ivA Method of Constructing Models of Random Sequences (cf. sections 58, 64, and 66) - c_d1e19369
Content:
We assume (as in section 55) that for every given finite number n a generating period can be constructed which is n-free (from after effect) and which shows equal distribution. In every such period, every combinatorially possible x-tuple (for x n + 1) of ones and zeros will appear at least once.*1
(a) We construct a model sequence which is ‘absolutely free’ (from after effect) in the following way. We write down an n-free period for an arbitrarily chosen n. This period will have a finite number of terms—say n1. We now write down a new period which is at least n1-1-free. Let the new period have the length n2. In this new period, at least one sequence must occur which is identical with the previously given period of length n1; and we rearrange the new period in such a way that it begins with this sequence (this is always possible, in accordance with the analysis of section 55). This we call the second period. We now write down another new period which is at least n2-1-free and seek in this third period that sequence which is identical with the second period (after rearrangement), and then so rearrange the third period that it begins with the second, and so on. In this way we obtain a sequence whose length increases very quickly and whose commencing period is the period which was written down first. This period, in turn, becomes the commencing sequence of the second period, and so on. By prescribing a particular commencing sequence together with some further conditions, e.g. that the periods to be written down must never be longer than necessary (so that they must be exactly ni -1-free, and not merely at least ni -1-free), this method of construction may be so improved as to become unambiguous and to define a definite sequence, so that we can calculate for every term of the sequence whether it is a one or a zero.*2 We thus have a (definite) sequence, constructed according to a mathematical rule, with frequencies whose limits are,

Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: APPENDIX vExamination of an Objection. The Two-Slit Experiment (cf.section 76)*1 - c_d1e19738
Content:
The imaginary experiment described below under (a) is intended to refute my assertion that arbitrarily exact simultaneous (non-predictive) measurements of the position and momentum of a particle are compatible with the quantum theory.
(a) Let A be a radiating atom, and let light from it fall on a screen S after passing through two slits, Sl1 and Sl2. According to Heisenberg we can in this case measure exactly either the position of A or the momentum of the radiation (but not both). If we measure the position exactly (an operation that ‘blurs’ or ‘smears’ the momentum) then we can assume that light is emitted from A in spherical waves. But if we measure the momentum exactly, for example by measuring the recoils due to the emission of photons (thereby ‘blurring’ or ‘smearing’ the position), then we are able to calculate the exact direction and the momentum of the emitted photons. In this case we shall have to regard the radiation as corpuscular (‘needle-radiation’). Thus to the two measuring operations there correspond two different kinds of radiation, so that we obtain two different experimental results. For if we measure the position exactly we obtain an interference-pattern on the screen: a point-like source of light—and one whose position can be exactly measured is point-like—emits coherent light. If on the other hand we measure the momentum exactly, we get no interference pattern. (Flashes of light, or scintillations, without interference pattern, appear on the screen after the photons have passed through the slits, consonantly with the fact that the position is ‘blurred’ or ‘smeared’ and that a non-point-like source of light does not emit coherent light.) If we were to suppose that we could measure both the position and the momentum exactly, then the atom would have to emit, on the one hand, according to the wave theory, continuous spherical waves that would produce interference patterns; and it would have to emit, on the other hand, an incoherent corpuscular beam of photons. (If we were able to calculate the path of each photon we should never get anything like ‘interference’, in view of the fact that photons neither destroy one another nor otherwise interact.) The assumption of exact measurements of position and momentum taken simultaneously leads thus to two mutually contradictory predictions. For on the one hand it leads to the prediction that interference patterns will appear, and on the other hand to the prediction that no interference patterns will appear.

Section: 17
Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: APPENDIX vi Concerning a Non-Predictive Procedure of Measuring (cf.section 77)*1 - c_d1e19845
Content:
We suppose that a non-monochromatic beam of particles—for instance a beam of light—moving along parallel paths in the x-direction is subjected to selection of their momenta by the interposition of a filter. (If the beam consists of electrons we shall have to use instead of a filter an electric field perpendicular to the direction of the beam in order to analyse its spectrum.) We assume with Heisenberg that this procedure leaves unaltered the momenta (or, more precisely, their components in the x-direction) and consequently also the velocities (or their x-components) of the selected particles.
Behind the filter we put a Geiger-counter (or a moving strip of photographic film) in order to measure the time of arrival of the particles; and this allows us—since the velocities of the particles are known—to calculate their x-co-ordinates for any instant preceding their time of arrival. Now we may consider two possible assumptions. If, on the one hand, it is assumed that the x-co-ordinates of the positions of the particles were not interfered with by the measuring of their momenta, then the measurement of position and momentum can be validly extended to the time before the momentum was selected (by the filter). If, on the other hand, it is assumed that a selection according to the momentum does interfere with the x-co-ordinates of the positions of the particles, then we can calculate their paths exactly only for the time-interval between the two measurements.

Section Title: APPENDIX viiRemarks Concerning an Imaginary Experiment (cf. section 77)*1 - c_d1e20009
Content:
We may start from the assumption that a1 and |b1| are measured, or selected, with an arbitrary degree of precision. In view of the result obtained in appendix vi, we may assume that the absolute momentum |a2| of the particle arriving at X from the direction PX can be measured with an arbitrary degree of precision. Accordingly, |b2| may also be determined as precisely as we choose (by using the principle of conservation of energy). Moreover, the position of Sl and X, and the instants of the arrival of the [A]-particles at X, can be measured with arbitrary precision. Thus we need only investigate the situation with respect to the indeterminacies Δa2 and Δb2, which arise in consequences of indeterminacies of the corresponding directions, and the vector ΔP connected with the indeterminacy of the position of P which also arises in consequence of the indeterminacy of a direction, viz. the direction PX.

Section Title: NOTE TO NEW APPENDICES, 1959 EDITION - c_d1e20458
Content:
Although I found, to my surprise, that I could still agree with almost all the philosophical views expressed in the book, and even with most of those on probability—a field in which my ideas have changed more than in any other—I felt that I had to append to it some of the new material accumulated through the years. There was a considerable amount of this, for I never stopped working on the problems raised in the book; and it was therefore not possible to include in these new appendices all my relevant results. I must mention especially one result that is missing here. It is the propensity interpretation of probability (as I call it). The exposition and discussion of this interpretation grew, quite against my intentions, until it became the main part of a new book.
The title of this new book is Postscript: After Twenty Years. It is a sequel to the present book, and it contains much that is closely related to it, quite apart from probability theory. In this connection I may also refer to two papers of mine which I might have included among these appendices had I not been reluctant to add to them any further. They are ‘Three Views Concerning Human Knowledge’, and ‘Philosophy of Science: A Personal Report’.1

Section Title: APPENDIX *i Two Notes on Induction and Demarcation, 1933–1934 - c_d1e20570
Content:
The first of the two notes here republished is a Letter to the Editor of Erkenntnis. The second is a contribution to a discussion at a philosophical conference in Prague, 1934. It was published in Erkenntnis in 1935, as part of the report on the conference.
1
The letter to the Editor was first published in 1933, in Erkenntnis, 3 (i.e. Annalen der Philosophie, 11) no. 4–6, pp. 426 f. I have broken up some of the paragraphs, for easier reading.
The letter was evoked by the fact that my views, at the time, were being widely discussed by members of the Vienna Circle, even in print (cf. note 3), although none of my own manuscripts (which had been read by some members of the Circle) had been published, partly because of their length: my book, Logik der Forschung, had to be cut to a fraction of its original length, to be acceptable for publication. The emphasis, in my letter, upon the difference between the problem of a criterion of demarcation and the pseudo-problem of a criterion of meaning (and upon the contrast between my views and those of Schlick and Wittgenstein) was provoked by the fact that even in those days my views were discussed, by the Circle, under the misappre-hension that I was advocating the replacement of the verifiability criterion of meaning by a falsifiability criterion of meaning, whereas in fact I was not concerned with the problem of meaning, but with the problem of demarcation. As my letter shows, I tried to correct this misinterpretation of my views as early as 1933. I have tried to do the same in my Logik der Forschung, and I have been trying ever since. But it appears that my positivist friends still cannot quite see the difference. These misunderstandings led me, in my letter, to point out, and to dwell upon, the contrast between my views and those of the Vienna Circle; and as a consequence, some people were led to assume, wrongly, that I had developed my views originally as a criticism of Wittgenstein. In fact, I had formulated the problem of demarcation and the falsifiability or testability criterion in the autumn of 1919, years before Wittgenstein’s views became a topic of discussion in Vienna. (Cf. my paper ‘Philosophy of Science: A Personal Report’, now in my Conjectures and Refutations.) This explains why, as soon as I heard of the Circle’s new verifiability criterion of meaning, I contrasted this with my falsi-fiability criterion—a criterion of demarcation, designed to demarcate systems of scientific statements from perfectly meaningful systems of metaphysical statements. (As to meaningless nonsense, I do not pretend that my criterion is applicable to it.)

Content:
The following note, ‘A Set of Independent Axioms for Probability’, was first published in Mind, N.S., 47, 1938, p. 275 ff. It is brief, but, unfortunately, it is badly written. It was my first publication in the English language; moreover, the proofs never reached me. (I was then in New Zealand.)
in New Zealand.)
The introductory text of the note, which alone is here reprinted, clearly states—and I believe for the first time—that the mathematical theory of probability should be constructed as a ‘formal’ system; that is to say, a system which should be susceptible of many different interpretations, among them, for example, (1) the classical interpretation, (2) the frequency interpretation, and (3) the logical interpretation (now sometimes called the ‘semantic’ interpretation).
One of the reasons why I wanted to develop a formal theory which would not depend upon any particular choice of an interpretation was that I hoped later to show that what I had called in my book ‘degree of corroboration’ (or of ‘confirmation’ or of ‘acceptability’) was not a ‘probability’: that its properties were incompatible with the formal calculus of probability. (Cf. appendix *ix, and my Postscript, sections *27 to *32).

Section Title: APPENDIX *iii On the Heuristic Use of the Classical Definition of Probability, Especially for Deriving the General Multiplication Theorem - c_d1e21880
Content:
The classical definition of probability as the number of favourable cases divided by the number of equally possible cases has considerable heuristic value. Its main drawback is that it is applicable to homogeneous or symmetrical dice, say, but not to biased dice; or in other words, that it does not make room for unequal weights of the possible cases. But in some special cases there are ways and means of getting over this difficulty; and it is in these cases that the old definition has its heuristic value: every satisfactory definition will have to agree with the old definition where the difficulty of assigning weights can be overcome, and therefore, a fortiori, in those cases in which the old definition turns out to be applicable.
(1) The classical definition will be applicable in all cases in which we conjecture that we are faced with equal weights, or equal possibilities, and therefore with equal probabilities.
(2) It will be applicable in all cases in which we can transform our problem so as to obtain equal weights or possibilities or probabilities.

Section Title: APPENDIX *iv The Formal Theory of Probability - c_d1e22164
Content:
In view of the fact that a probability statement such as ‘p(a, b) = r’ can be interpreted in many ways, it appeared to me desirable to construct a purely ‘formal’ or ‘abstract’ or ‘autonomous’ system, in the sense that its ‘elements’ (represented by ‘a’, ‘b’,... ) can be interpreted in many ways, so that we are not bound to any particular one of these interpretations. I proposed first a formal axiom system of this kind in a Note in Mind in 1938 (here re-printed in appendix *ii). Since then, I have constructed many simplified systems.1
There exists an element a in S such that
There are three main characteristics which distinguish a theory of this kind from others. (i) It is formal; that is to say, it does not assume any particular interpretation, although allowing for at least all known interpretations. (ii) It is autonomous; that is to say, it adheres to the principle that probability conclusions can be derived only from probability premises; in other words, to the principle that the calculus of probabilities is a method of transforming probabilities into other probabilities. (iii) It is symmetrical; that is to say, it is so constructed that whenever there is a probability p(b, a)—i.e. a probability of b given a— then there is always a probability p(a, b) also—even when the absolute probability of b, p(b), equals zero; that is, even when = 0.

Section Title: APPENDIX *v Derivations in the Formal Theory of Probability - c_d1e27231
Content:
In this appendix I propose to give the most important derivations from the system of postulates which has been explained in appendix *iv. I am going to show how the laws of the upper and lower bounds, of idempotence, commutation, association, and distribution are obtained, as well as a simpler definition of absolute probability. I will also indicate how Boolean algebra is derivable in the system. A fuller treatment will be given elsewhere.
As an abbreviation for ‘if... then...’, I am going to use an arrow ‘... →...’; a double arrow ‘.. ..’, for ‘... if and only if...’; ‘&’ for ‘and’; ‘(Ea)...’ for ‘there is an a in S such that...’; and ‘(a)...’ for ‘for all a in S,...’.
I first re-state postulate 2 and the six operational axioms which will all be cited in the proofs. (The other postulates will be used implicitly; even postulate 2 will be cited only once, in the proof of 5.) In reading the axioms A3 and C, it should be kept in mind that I shall soon prove—see formula 25—that p(a, a) = 1.

Section Title: APPENDIX *vi On Objective Disorder or Randomness - c_d1e31996
Content:
It is essential for an objective theory of probability and its application to such concepts as entropy (or molecular disorder) to give an objective characterization of disorder or randomness, as a type of order.
In this appendix, I intend to indicate briefly some of the general problems this characterization may help to solve, and the way in which they may be approached.
(1) The distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas in equilibrium is supposed to be (very nearly) random. Similarly, the distribution of nebulae in the universe appears to be random, with a constant over-all density of occurrence. The occurrence of rain on Sundays is random: in the long run, each day of the week gets equal amounts of rain, and the fact that there was rain on Wednesday (or any other day) may not help us to predict whether or not there will be rain on Sunday.
(2) We have certain statistical tests of randomness.

Section Title: APPENDIX *vii Zero Probability and the Fine-Structure of Probability and of Content - c_d1e32237
Content:
In the book, a sharp distinction is made between the idea of the probability of a hypothesis, and its degree of corroboration. It is asserted that if we say of a hypothesis that it is well corroborated, we do not say more than that it has been severely tested (it must be thus a hypothesis with a high degree of testability) and that it has stood up well to the severest tests we were able to design so far. And it is further asserted that degree of corroboration cannot be a probability, because it cannot satisfy the laws of the probability calculus. For the laws of the probability calculus demand that, of two hypotheses, the one that is logically stronger, or more informative, or better testable, and thus the one which can be better corroborated, is always less probable—on any given evidence—than the other. (See especially sections 82 and 83.)

Section: 27
Book Title: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
Section Title: APPENDIX *viiiContent, Simplicity, and Dimension - c_d1e34974
Content:
As indicated earlier,1 I do not believe in hampering scientific language by preventing the scientist from using freely, whenever it is convenient, new ideas, predicates, ‘occult’ concepts, or anything else. For this reason, I cannot support the various recent attempts to introduce into the philosophy of science the method of artificial calculi or ‘language systems’—systems supposed to be models of a simplified ‘language of science’. I believe that these attempts have not only been useless so far, but that they have even contributed to the obscurity and confusion prevalent in the philosophy of science.
It has been briefly explained in section 38 and in appendix i that, had we (absolutely) atomic statements at our disposal—or what amounts to the same, (absolutely) atomic predicates—then we might introduce, as a measure of the content of a theory, the reciprocal of the minimum number of atomic statements needed for refuting that theory. For since the degree of content of a theory is the same as its degree of testability or refutability, the theory which is refutable by fewer atomic statements would also be the one which is the more easily refutable or testable, and thus the one with the greater content. (In brief, the smaller the number of atomic statements needed to compose a potential falsifier, the greater the content of the theory.)

Section Title: APPENDIX *ixCorroboration, the Weight of Evidence, and Statistical Tests - c_d1e36000
Content:
The three notes reprinted below in the present appendix were originally published in The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science.1
Even before my book was published, I felt that the problem of degree of corroboration was one of those problems which should be further investigated. By ‘the problem of degree of corroboration’ I mean the problem (i) of showing that there exists a measure (to be called degree of corroboration) of the severity of tests to which a theory has been subjected, and of the manner in which it has passed these tests, or failed them; and (ii) of showing that this measure cannot be a probability, or more precisely, that it does not satisfy the formal laws of the probability calculus.
An outline of the solution of both of these tasks—especially the second—was contained in my book. But I felt that a little more was needed. It was not quite enough to show the failure of the existing theories of probability—of Keynes and of Jeffreys, for example, or of Kaila, or of Reichenbach, none of whom could establish even their central doctrine: that a universal law, or a theory, could ever reach a probability > 1/2. (They even failed to establish that a universal law, or a theory, could ever have a probability other than zero.) What was needed was a perfectly general treatment. I therefore aimed at constructing a formal probability calculus which could be interpreted in various senses. I had in mind (i) the logical sense, outlined in my book as (absolute) logical probability of statements; (ii) the sense of relative logical probability of statements or propositions, as envisaged by Keynes; (iii) the sense of a calculus of relative frequencies in sequences; (iv) the sense of a calculus of a measure of ranges, or of predicates, classes, or sets.

Content:
(1) The fundamental doctrine which underlies all theories of induction is the doctrine of the primacy of repetitions. Keeping Hume’s attitude in mind, we may distinguish two variants of this doctrine. The first (which Hume criticized) may be called the doctrine of the logical primacy of repetitions. According to this doctrine, repeated instances furnish a kind of justification for the acceptance of a universal law. (The idea of repetition is linked, as a rule, with that of probability.) The second (which Hume upheld) may be called the doctrine of the temporal (and psychological) primacy of repetitions. According to this second doctrine, repetitions, even though they should fail to furnish and kind of justification for a universal law and for the expectations and beliefs which it entails, nevertheless induce and arouse these expectations and beliefs in us, as a matter of fact—however little ‘justified’ or ‘rational’ this fact (or these beliefs) may be.

Section Title: APPENDIX *xiOn the Use and Misuse of Imaginary Experiments, Especially in Quantum Theory - c_d1e44478
Content:
The criticisms presented in the later parts of this appendix are logical in character. My point is not to refute certain arguments, some of which, for all I know, may have long been discarded by their originators. I try, rather, to show that certain methods of argument are inadmissible— methods which have been used, without being challenged, for many years in the discussions about the interpretation of quantum theory. It is, in the main, the apologetic use of imaginary experiments which I am criticizing here, rather than any particular theory in whose defence these experiments were propounded.1 Least of all do I wish to create the impression that I am doubting the fruitfulness of imaginary experiments.
(1) One of the most important imaginary experiments in the history of natural philosophy, and one of the simplest and most ingenious arguments in the history of rational thought about our universe, is contained in Galileo’s criticism of Aristotle’s theory of motion.2 It disproves the Aristotelian supposition that the natural velocity of a heavier body is greater than that of a lighter body. ‘If we take two moving bodies’, Galileo’s spokesman argues, ‘such that their natural velocities are unequal, it is manifest that if we join them together, the slower and the faster one, then the latter will be partly retarded by the slower one, and the slower partly sped up by the faster one’. Thus ‘if a big stone moves, for example, with a velocity of eight steps and a smaller one with a velocity of four, then, after being joined together, the composite system will move with a velocity of less than eight steps. But the two stones joined together make a stone bigger than the first one which moved with a velocity of eight steps. Thus the composite body (although bigger than the first alone) will nevertheless move more slowly than the first alone; which is contrary to your supposition.’3 And since this Aristotelian supposition was the one from which the argument started, it is now refuted: it is shown to be absurd.

Section Title: APPENDIX *xii The Experiment of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen - c_d1e45349
Content:
The letter from Albert Einstein here printed in translation briefly and decisively disposes of my imaginary experiment of section 77 of the book (it also refers to a slightly different version contained in an unpublished paper), and it goes on to describe with admirable clarity the imaginary experiment of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (Physical Review 47, 1935, pp. 777–780; cf. my note on p. 232 and section 3 of my appendix *xi).
Between these two points, a few remarks will be found on the relation of theory and experiment in general, and upon the influence of positivistic ideas upon the interpretation of quantum theory.
The two last paragraphs of the letter also deal with a problem discussed in my book (and in my Postscript)—the problem of subjective probabilities, and of drawing statistical conclusions from nescience. In this I still disagree with Einstein: I believe that we draw these probabilistic conclusions from conjectures about equidistribution (often very natural conjectures, and for this reason perhaps not always consciously made), and therefore from probabilistic premises.

AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1993
I do not regard myself as an expert in either science or philosophy. I have, however, tried hard all my life to understand something of the world we live in. Scientific knowledge, and the human rationality that produces it, are, I believe, always fallible, or subject to error. But they are, I believe, also the pride of mankind. For man is, so far as I know, the only thing in the universe that tries to understand what it is all about. May we continue to do so, and may we also be aware of the severe limitations of all our contributions.
For many years I have argued against intellectual fashions in the sciences, and even more against intellectual fashions in philosophy. The fashionable thinker is, in the main, a prisoner of his fashion, and I regard freedom, political freedom as well as a free and open mind, as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, value that our life can offer us.

INTRODUCTION
All, or almost all, the papers collected in this volume are written to defend rationality and rational criticism. It is a way of thinking, and even a way of living: a readiness to listen to critical arguments, to search for one’s own mistakes, and to learn from them. It is, fundamentally, an attitude that I have tried to formulate (perhaps first in 1932) in the following two lines:
‘I may be wrong and you may be right,
and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.’
These two lines in italics here quoted were first printed in 1945 in my Open Society (volume II, the second page of chapter 24, ‘The Revolt Against Reason’); and I italicized the lines in order to indicate that I regarded them as important. For these two lines were an attempt to summarize a very central part of my moral articles of faith. The view that they summed up I called ‘critical rationalism’.

THE RATIONALITY OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS
Selection versus instruction
The title of this series of Spencer lectures, ‘Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences’, was chosen by the organizers of the series. The title seems to imply that progress in science is a good thing, and that an obstacle to progress is a bad thing – a position held by almost everybody until quite recently. Perhaps I should make it clear at once that I accept this position, although with some slight and faintly obvious reservations to which I shall briefly allude later. Of course, obstacles which are due to the inherent difficulty of the problems tackled are welcome challenges. (Indeed, many scientists were greatly disappointed when it turned out that the problem of tapping nuclear energy was comparatively trivial, involving no new revolutionary change of theory.) But stagnation in science would be a curse. Still, I agree with Professor Bodmer’s suggestion that scientific advance is only a mixed blessing1. Let’s face it: blessings are mixed, though there may be some exceedingly rare exceptions.

THE MYTH OF THE FRAMEWORK
Those who believe this, and those who do not, have no common ground of discussion, but in view of their opinions they must of necessity scorn each other.
Plato
I
One of the more disturbing aspects of the intellectual life of our time is the way in which irrationalism is so widely advocated, and the way in which irrationalist doctrines are taken for granted. One of the components of modern irrationalism is relativism (the doctrine that truth is relative to our intellectual background, which is supposed to determine somehow the framework within which we are able to think: that truth may change from one framework to another), and, in particular, the doctrine of the impossibility of mutual understanding between different cultures, generations, or historical periods – even within science, even within physics. In this paper I discuss the problem of relativism. It is my claim that behind it lies what I call ‘The Myth of the Framework’. I explain and criticize this myth, and comment also on arguments that have been used in its defence.

I will begin by telling some of the history of the book and of its misleading title. In 1960 I was invited to open a discussion on ‘The Logic of the Social Sciences’ at a congress of German sociologists in Tübingen. I accepted – and I was told that my opening address would be followed by a reply from Professor Theodor W. Adorno of Frankfurt. It was suggested to me by the organizers that, in order to make a fruitful discussion possible, I should formulate my views in a number of definite theses. This I did: my opening address to that discussion, delivered in 1961, consisted of twenty-seven sharply formulated theses, plus a programmatic formulation of the task of the theoretical social sciences. Of course, I formulated these theses so as to make it difficult for any Hegelian or Marxist (such as Adorno) to accept them. And I supported them as well as I could by arguments. Owing to the limited time available, I confined myself to fundamentals, and I tried to avoid repeating what I had said elsewhere.

SCIENCE: PROBLEMS, AIMS, RESPONSIBILITIES
I
The intellectual history of man has its depressing as well as its exhilarating aspects. For one may well look upon it as a history of prejudice and dogma, tenaciously held, and often combined with intolerance and fanaticism. One may even describe it as a history of spells of religious or quasi-religious frenzy. It should be remembered, in this context, that most of our great destructive wars have been religious or ideological wars – with the notable exception, perhaps, of the wars of Genghis Khan, who seems to have been a model of religious toleration.
Yet even the sad and depressing picture of religious wars has its brighter side. It is an encouraging fact that countless men, from ancient to modern times, have been ready to live and to die for their convictions, for ideas – ideas which they believed to be true.

PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS
The influence on theoretical and experimental physics of some metaphysical speculations on the structure of matter
The following remarks are intended as an illustration of the important thesis that science is capable of solving philosophical problems and that modern science, at any rate, has something important to say to the philosopher about some of the classical problems of philosophy – especially about the old problem of matter. I intend to discuss certain aspects of the problem of matter since Descartes. And I intend to point out the interesting fact that some of these problems were solved, in collaboration, by speculative philosophers, such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant, who all helped by proposing important though tentative solutions and thus prepared the way for the work of experimental scientists and theorists of physics such as Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, de Broglie, and Schrödinger.

THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCIENTIST
The topic I am going to discuss was not of my choosing, but was suggested by the organizers of this conference. I say this because I do not think that I can make any significant contribution to the solution of the grave problems involved. I nevertheless accepted the invitation to speak about it because I believe that in this respect we are all more or less in the same boat. I take it that our topic, ‘the moral responsibility of the scientist’, is a kind of euphemism for the issue of nuclear and biological warfare. But I shall try to approach our topic with some wider issues in mind.
One may say that the problem has lately become more general, due to the fact that lately all science, and indeed all learning, has tended to become potentially applicable. Formerly, the pure scientist or the pure scholar had only one responsibility beyond those which everyone else has – that is, to search for truth. He had to further the growth of his subject as well as he could. For all I know, Maxwell had little reason to worry about the possible applications of his equations. And perhaps even Hertz did not worry about Hertzian waves. This happy situation belongs to the past. Today not only all pure science may become applied science, but even all pure scholarship.

A PLURALIST APPROACH TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
I
What may be called the philosophy of history persistently turns round three big questions.
1 Is there a plot to history, and if so, what is it?
2 What is the use of history?
3 How are we to write history, or what is the method of history?
(This also includes the ‘problem of historical knowledge’.)
Answers to these three questions have been given, implicitly and explicitly, from the Bible and Homer down to our own day. And the answers have changed astonishingly little.
The oldest answer to our first question, given in the Bible and in Homer, is theistic. There is a plot to history. But it is only dimly discernible, because it results from the will of God, or of the gods. And though it is perhaps not completely unfathomable, it is not easy to fathom. At any rate, there is something secret hidden behind the surface of events. It has to do with reward and punishment, with a kind of divine balance of justice – though only by the most discerning can justice be seen to be done.

MODELS, INSTRUMENTS, AND TRUTH
The status of the rationality principle in the social sciences
When I received the invitation to present to you my views on the methodology of the social sciences, I felt very honoured indeed. But I also felt a little uneasy, for the following reasons. My views on the methodology of the social sciences are the result of my admiration for economic theory: I began to develop them, some twenty-five years ago, by trying to generalize the method of theoretical economics.1 You will understand my fear that you may, as economists, find my views trivial – if not altogether out of date.
It was this fear that made me decide to devote about one-third of this lecture to my views on the methodology of science in general, one third (sections 2 to 7) to problems peculiar to the methods of social science, and the remainder (sections 8 to 11) to an attack upon the instrumentalist philosophy of science – that still fashionable philosophical theory of pragmatism which tells us that our theories are nothing but instruments. To this I shall oppose my own view according to which theories are steps in our search for truth – or to be both more explicit and more modest, in our search for better and better solutions of deeper and deeper problems (where ‘better and better’ means, as we shall see, ‘nearer and nearer to the truth’).2

EPISTEMOLOGY AND INDUSTRIALIZATION
Francis Bacon looked forward to an alteration in the form of production and to the effective control of nature by man, as a result of a change in the ways of thinking.
Karl Marx
I
In a famous and highly dramatic passage of his chief work, Plato demands that philosophers should be kings and, vice versa, that kings – or autocratic rulers – should be fully trained philosophers.1 Plato’s proposal that philosophers should be kings has pleased many philosophers, and some of them have taken it quite seriously. Personally I do not find it an attractive proposal. Quite apart from the fact that I am against any form of autocracy or dictatorship, including the dictatorship of the wisest and best, philosophers do not seem to me particularly well suited for the job. Take for example the case of Thomas Masaryk, the creator, first president and, one might say, the philosopher-king of the Czechoslovak Republic. Masaryk was not only a fully trained philosopher, but also a born statesman and a great and admirable man. And his creation, the Czechoslovak Republic, was an unparalleled political achievement. Yet the dissolution of the Old Austrian Empire was also partly Masaryk’s work. And this proved a disaster for Europe and the world. For the instability that followed this dissolution was largely responsible for the rise of Nazism and finally even for the downfall of Masaryk’s own Czechoslovak Republic. And it is significant that Masaryk’s doctrine that ‘Austria-Hungary, this antinational … state, must be dismembered’2 (to use his own words) was derived from a mistaken philosophical doctrine: from the philosophical principle of the National State.3 But this principle, the principle of political nationalism, is not only an unfortunate and even a mischievous conception, it is also one that is actually impossible to realize. This is because Nations – in the sense of those who advocate this principle – do not exist: they are theoretical constructs, and the theories in which they are constructed are wholly inadequate, and completely inapplicable to Europe. For the political theory of nationalism rests on the assumption that there are ethnic groups which at the same time are also linguistic groups, and which happen also to inhabit geographically unified and coherent regions with natural boundaries that are defensible from a military point of view – groups which are united by a common language, a common territory, a common history, a common culture, and a common fate. The boundaries of the regions inhabited by these groups should, according to the theory of the Nation State, form boundaries of the new national states.

Karl Popper was one of the most important philosophers of science of the twentieth century, and among the most important philosophers of the century tout court. Unlike most philosophers of science, he was admired by practising scientists, several of whom claimed that he had influenced their work. They included the Nobel prizewinners Sir Peter Medawar and Sir John Eccles. Popper’s influence was reflected in the fact that he enjoyed the rare distinction of being a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the British Academy. Although The Open Society and Its Enemies is commonly thought of as a work of political theory, it is just as much a work in the philosophy of history and social science, and because Popper thought there were no important methodological differences between the social and natural sciences, it bears directly on Popper’s philosophy of the natural sciences, too.
Although The Open Society’s assault on Plato, Hegel, and Marx—its primary targets—rests on ideas formulated in Popper’s philosophy of science, his political interests had underpinned the development of his philosophy of science in the first place. Popper wrote The Open Society and completed a companion essay on the philosophy of history, The Poverty of Historicism, in New Zealand during the Second World War, but their roots lie in Viennese politics, and more specifically in the catastrophes that befell Austrian socialism.

Although much of what is contained in this book took shape at an earlier date, the final decision to write it was made in March 1938, on the day I received the news of the invasion of Austria. The writing extended into 1943; and the fact that most of the book was written during the grave years when the outcome of the war was uncertain may help to explain why some of its criticism strikes me to-day as more emotional and harsher in tone than I could wish. But it was not the time to mince words—or at least, this was what I then felt. Neither the war nor any other contemporary event was explicitly mentioned in the book; but it was an attempt to understand those events and their background, and some of the issues which were likely to arise after the war was won. The expectation that Marxism would become a major problem was the reason for treating it at some length.
Seen in the darkness of the present world situation, the criticism of Marxism which it attempts is liable to stand out as the main point of the book. This view of it is not wholly wrong and perhaps unavoidable, although the aims of the book are much wider. Marxism is only an episode—one of the many mistakes we have made in the perennial and dangerous struggle for building a better and freer world.

It sketches some of the difficulties faced by our civilization—a civilization which might be perhaps described as aiming at humaneness and reasonableness, at equality and freedom; a civilization which is still in its infancy, as it were, and which continues to grow in spite of the fact that it has been so often betrayed by so many of the intellectual leaders of mankind. It attempts to show that this civilization has not yet fully recovered from the shock of its birth—the transition from the tribal or ‘closed society’, with its submission to magical forces, to the ‘open society’ which sets free the critical powers of man. It attempts to show that the shock of this transition is one of the factors that have made possible the rise of those reactionary movements which have tried, and still try, to overthrow civilization and to return to tribalism. And it suggests that what we call nowadays totalitarianism belongs to a tradition which is just as old or just as young as our civilization itself.

It is widely believed that a truly scientific or philosophical attitude towards politics, and a deeper understanding of social life in general, must be based upon a contemplation and interpretation of human history. While the ordinary man takes the setting of his life and the importance of his personal experiences and petty struggles for granted, it is said that the social scientist or philosopher has to survey things from a higher plane. He sees the individual as a pawn, as a somewhat insignificant instrument in the general development of mankind. And he finds that the really important actors on the Stage of History are either the Great Nations and their Great Leaders, or perhaps the Great Classes, or the Great Ideas. However this may be, he will try to understand the meaning of the play which is performed on the Historical Stage; he will try to understand the laws of historical development. If he succeeds in this, he will, of course, be able to predict future developments. He might then put politics upon a solid basis, and give us practical advice by telling us which political actions are likely to succeed or likely to fail.

It is not until Heraclitus that we find in Greece theories which could be compared in their historicist character with the doctrine of the chosen people. In Homer’s theistic or rather polytheistic interpretation, history is the product of divine will. But the Homeric gods do not lay down general laws for its development. What Homer tries to stress and to explain is not the unity of history, but rather its lack of unity. The author of the play on the Stage of History is not one God; a whole variety of gods dabble in it. What the Homeric interpretation shares with the Jewish is a certain vague feeling of destiny, and the idea of powers behind the scenes. But ultimate destiny, according to Homer, is not disclosed; unlike its Jewish counterpart, it remains mysterious.
The first Greek to introduce a more markedly historicist doctrine was Hesiod, who was probably influenced by oriental sources. He made use of the idea of a general trend or tendency in historical development. His interpretation of history is pessimistic. He believes that mankind, in their development down from the Golden Age, are destined to degenerate, both physically and morally. The culmination of the various historicist ideas proffered by the early Greek philosophers came with Plato, who, in an attempt to interpret the history and social life of the Greek tribes, and especially of the Athenians, painted a grandiose philosophical picture of the world. He was strongly influenced in his historicism by various forerunners, especially by Hesiod; but the most important influence came from Heraclitus.

Plato lived in a period of wars and of political strife which was, for all we know, even more unsettled than that which had troubled Heraclitus. While he grew up, the breakdown of the tribal life of the Greeks had led in Athens, his native city, to a period of tyranny, and later to the establishment of a democracy which tried jealously to guard itself against any attempts to reintroduce either a tyranny or an oligarchy, i.e. a rule of the leading aristocratic families1. During his youth, democratic Athens was involved in a deadly war against Sparta, the leading city-state of the Peloponnese, which had preserved many of the laws and customs of the ancient tribal aristocracy. The Peloponnesian war lasted, with an interruption, for twenty-eight years. (In chapter 10, where the historical background is reviewed in more detail, it will be shown that the war did not end with the fall of Athens in 404 B.C., as is sometimes asserted2.) Plato was born during the war, and he was about twenty-four when it ended. It brought terrible epidemics, and, in its last year, famine, the fall of the city of Athens, civil war, and a rule of terror, usually called the rule of the Thirty Tyrants; these were led by two of Plato’s uncles, who both lost their lives in the unsuccessful attempt to uphold their régime against the democrats. The re-establishment of the democracy and of peace meant no respite for Plato. His beloved teacher Socrates, whom he later made the main speaker of most of his dialogues, was tried and executed. Plato himself seems to have been in danger; together with other companions of Socrates he left Athens.

Plato was one of the first social scientists and undoubtedly by far the most influential. In the sense in which the term ‘sociology’ was understood by Comte, Mill, and Spencer, he was a sociologist; that is to say, he successfully applied his idealist method to an analysis of the social life of man, and of the laws of its development as well as the laws and conditions of its stability. In spite of Plato’s great influence, this side of his teaching has been little noticed. This seems to be due to two factors. First of all, much of Plato’s sociology is presented by him in such close connection with his ethical and political demands that the descriptive elements have been largely overlooked. Secondly, many of his thoughts were taken so much for granted that they were simply absorbed unconsciously and therefore uncritically. It is mainly in this way that his sociological theories became so influential.
Plato’s sociology is an ingenious blend of speculation with acute observation of facts. Its speculative setting is, of course, the theory of Forms and of universal flux and decay, of generation and degeneration. But on this idealist foundation Plato constructs an astonishingly realistic theory of society, capable of explaining the main trends in the historical development of the Greek city-states as well as the social and political forces at work in his own day.

Plato was not the first to approach social phenomena in the spirit of scientific investigation. The beginning of social science goes back at least to the generation of Protagoras, the first of the great thinkers who called themselves ‘Sophists’. It is marked by the realization of the need to distinguish between two different elements in man’s environment—his natural environment and his social environment. This is a distinction which is difficult to make and to grasp, as can be inferred from the fact that even now it is not clearly established in our minds. It has been questioned ever since the time of Protagoras. Most of us, it seems, have a strong inclination to accept the peculiarities of our social environment as if they were ‘natural’.
It is one of the characteristics of the magical attitude of a primitive tribal or ‘closed’ society that it lives in a charmed circle1 of unchanging taboos, of laws and customs which are felt to be as inevitable as the rising of the sun, or the cycle of the seasons, or similar obvious regularities of nature. And it is only after this magical ‘closed society’ has actually broken down that a theoretical understanding of the difference between ‘nature’ and ‘society’ can develop.

The analysis of Plato’s sociology makes it easy to present his political programme. His fundamental demands can be expressed in either of two formulæ, the first corresponding to his idealist theory of change and rest, the second to his naturalism. The idealist formula is: Arrest all political change! Change is evil, rest divine1. All change can be arrested if the state is made an exact copy of its original, i.e. of the Form or Idea of the city. Should it be asked how this is practicable, we can reply with the naturalistic formula: Back to nature! Back to the original state of our forefathers, the primitive state founded in accordance with human nature, and therefore stable; back to the tribal patriarchy of the time before the Fall, to the natural class rule of the wise few over the ignorant many.
I believe that practically all the elements of Plato’s political programme can be derived from these demands. They are, in turn, based upon his historicism; and they have to be combined with his sociological doctrines concerning the conditions for the stability of class rule. The principal elements I have in mind are:

PLATO.
Certain objections1 to our interpretation of Plato’s political programme have forced us into an investigation of the part played, within this programme, by such moral ideas as Justice, Goodness, Beauty, Wisdom, Truth, and Happiness. The present and the two following chapters are to continue this analysis, and the part played by the idea of Wisdom in Plato’s political philosophy will occupy us next.
We have seen that Plato’s idea of justice demands, fundamentally, that the natural rulers should rule and the natural slaves should slave. It is part of the historicist demand that the state, in order to arrest all change, should be a copy of its Idea, or of its true ‘nature’. This theory of justice indicates very clearly that Plato saw the fundamental problem of politics in the question: Who shall rule the state?

The contrast between the Platonic and the Socratic creed is even greater than I have shown so far. Plato, I have said, followed Socrates in his definition of the philosopher. ‘Whom do you call true philosophers?—Those who love truth’, we read in the Republic1. But he himself is not quite truthful when he makes this statement. He does not really believe in it, for he bluntly declares in other places that it is one of the royal privileges of the sovereign to make full use of lies and deceit: ‘It is the business of the rulers of the city, if it is anybody’s, to tell lies, deceiving both its enemies and its own citizens for the benefit of the city; and no one else must touch this privilege.’2

Inherent in Plato’s programme there is a certain approach towards politics which, I believe, is most dangerous. Its analysis is of great practical importance from the point of view of rational social engineering. The Platonic approach I have in mind can be described as that of Utopian engineering, as opposed to another kind of social engineering which I consider as the only rational one, and which may be described by the name of piecemeal engineering. The Utopian approach is the more dangerous as it may seem to be the obvious alternative to an out-and-out historicism—to a radically historicist approach which implies that we cannot alter the course of history; at the same time, it appears to be a necessary complement to a less radical historicism, like that of Plato, which permits human interference.

There is still something missing from our analysis. The contention that Plato’s political programme is purely totalitarian, and the objections to this contention which were raised in chapter 6, have led us to examine the part played, within this programme, by such moral ideas as Justice, Wisdom, Truth, and Beauty. The result of this examination was always the same. We found that the rôle of these ideas is important, but that they do not lead Plato beyond totalitarianism and racialism. But one of these ideas we have still to examine: that of Happiness. It may be remembered that we quoted Crossman in connection with the belief that Plato’s political programme is fundamentally a ‘plan for the building of a perfect state in which every citizen is really happy’, and that I described this belief as a relic of the tendency to idealize Plato. If called upon to justify my opinion, I should not have much difficulty in pointing out that Plato’s treatment of happiness is exactly analogous to his treatment of justice; and especially, that it is based upon the same belief that society is ‘by nature’ divided into classes or castes. True happiness1, Plato insists, is achieved only by justice, i.e. by keeping one’s place. The ruler must find happiness in ruling, the warrior in warring; and, we may infer, the slave in slaving. Apart from that, Plato says frequently that what he is aiming at is neither the happiness of individuals nor that of any particular class in the state, but only the happiness of the whole, and this, he argues, is nothing but the outcome of that rule of justice which I have shown to be totalitarian in character. That only this justice can lead to any true happiness is one of the main theses of the Republic.

The task of writing a history of the ideas in which we are interested—of historicism and its connection with totalitarianism—will not be attempted here. The reader will remember, I hope, that I do not even try to give more than a few scattered remarks which may throw light on the background of the modern version of these ideas. The story of their development, more particularly during the period from Plato to Hegel and Marx, could not possibly be told while keeping the size of the book within reasonable limits. I shall therefore not attempt a serious treatment of Aristotle, except in so far as his version of Plato’s essentialism has influenced the historicism of Hegel, and thereby that of Marx. The restriction to those ideas of Aristotle with which we have become acquainted in our criticism of Plato, Aristotle’s great master, does not, however, create as serious a loss as one might fear at first sight. For Aristotle, in spite of his stupendous learning and his astonishing scope, was not a man of striking originality of thought. What he added to the Platonic store of ideas was, in the main, systematization and a burning interest in empirical and especially in biological problems. To be sure, he is the inventor of logic, and for this and his other achievements, he amply deserves what he himself claimed (at the end of his Sophistic Refutations)—our warm thanks, and our pardon for his shortcomings. Yet for readers and admirers of Plato these shortcomings are formidable.

The philosophy of Hegel, then, was … a scrutiny of thought so profound that it was for the most part unintelligible …
J. H. STIRLING.
Hegel, the source of all contemporary historicism, was a direct follower of Heraclitus, Plato, and Aristotle. Hegel achieved the most miraculous things. A master logician, it was child’s play for his powerful dialectical methods to draw real physical rabbits out of purely metaphysical silk-hats. Thus, starting from Plato’s Timaeus and its number-mysticism, Hegel succeeded in ‘proving’ by purely philosophical methods (114 years after Newton’s Principia) that the planets must move according to Kepler’s laws. He even accomplished1 the deduction of the actual position of the planets, thereby proving that no planet could be situated between Mars and Jupiter (unfortunately, it had escaped his notice that such a planet had been discovered a few months earlier). Similarly, he proved that magnetizing iron means increasing its weight, that Newton’s theories of inertia and of gravity contradict each other (of course, he could not foresee that Einstein would show the identity of inert and gravitating mass), and many other things of this kind. That such a surprisingly powerful philosophical method was taken seriously can be only partially explained by the backwardness of German natural science in those days. For the truth is, I think, that it was not at first taken really seriously by serious men (such as Schopenhauer, or J. F. Fries), not at any rate by those scientists who, like Democritus2, ‘would rather find a single causal law than be the king of Persia’. Hegel’s fame was made by those who prefer a quick initiation into the deeper secrets of this world to the laborious technicalities of a science which, after all, may only disappoint them by its lack of power to unveil all mysteries. For they soon found out that nothing could be applied with such ease to any problem whatsoever, and at the same time with such impressive (though only apparent) difficulty, and with such quick and sure but imposing success, nothing could be used as cheaply and with so little scientific training and knowledge, and nothing would give such a spectacular scientific air, as did Hegelian dialectics, the mystery method that replaced ‘barren formal logic’. Hegel’s success was the beginning of the ‘age of dishonesty’ (as Schopenhauer3 described the period of German Idealism) and of the ‘age of irresponsibility’ (as K. Heiden characterizes the age of modern totalitarianism); first of intellectual, and later, as one of its consequences, of moral irresponsibility; of a new age controlled by the magic of high-sounding words, and by the power of jargon.

The collectivists … have the zest for progress, the sympathy for the poor, the burning sense of wrong, the impulse for great deeds, which have been lacking in latter-day liberalism. But their science is founded on a profound misunderstanding …, and their actions, therefore, are deeply destructive and reactionary. So men’s hearts are torn, their minds divided, they are offered impossible choices.

It has always been the strategy of the revolt against freedom ‘to take advantage of sentiments, not wasting one’s energies in futile efforts to destroy them’1. The most cherished ideas of the humanitarians were often loudly acclaimed by their deadliest enemies, who in this way penetrated into the humanitarian camp under the guise of allies, causing disunion and thorough confusion. This strategy has often been highly successful, as is shown by the fact that many genuine humanitarians still revere Plato’s idea of ‘justice’, the medieval idea of ‘Christian’ authoritarianism, Rousseau’s idea of the ‘general will’, or Fichte’s and Hegel’s ideas of ‘national freedom’.2 Yet this method of penetrating dividing and confusing the humanitarian camp and of building up a largely unwitting and therefore doubly effective intellectual fifth column achieved its greatest success only after Hegelianism had established itself as the basis of a truly humanitarian movement: of Marxism, so far the purest, the most developed and the most dangerous form of historicism.

A concise formulation of Marx’s opposition to psychologism1, i.e. to the plausible doctrine that all laws of social life must be ultimately reducible to the psychological laws of ‘human nature’, is his famous epigram: ‘It is not the consciousness of man that determines his existence—rather, it is his social existence that determines his consciousness.’2 The function of the present chapter as well as of the two following ones is mainly to elucidate this epigram. And I may state at once that in developing what I believe to be Marx’s anti-psychologism, I am developing a view to which I subscribe myself.
As an elementary illustration, and a first step in our examination, we may refer to the problem of the so-called rules of exogamy, i.e. the problem of explaining the wide distribution, among the most diverse cultures, of marriage laws apparently designed to prevent inbreeding. Mill and his psychologistic school of sociology (it was joined later by many psychoanalysts) would try to explain these rules by an appeal to ‘human nature’, for instance to some sort of instinctive aversion against incest (developed perhaps through natural selection, or else through ‘repression’); and something like this would also be the naïve or popular explanation. Adopting the point of view expressed in Marx’s epigram, however, one could ask whether it is not the other way round, that is to say, whether the apparent instinct is not rather a product of education, the effect rather than the cause of the social rules and traditions demanding exogamy and forbidding incest3. It is clear that these two approaches correspond exactly to the very ancient problem whether social laws are ‘natural’ or ‘conventional’ (dealt with at length in chapter 5). In a question such as the one chosen here as an illustration, it would be difficult to determine which of the two theories is the correct one, the explanation of the traditional social rules by instinct or the explanation of an apparent instinct by traditional social rules. The possibility of deciding such questions by experiment has, however, been shown in a similar case, that of the apparently instinctive aversion to snakes. This aversion has a greater semblance of being instinctive or ‘natural’ in that it is exhibited not only by men but also by all anthropoid apes and by most monkeys as well. But experiments seem to indicate that this fear is conventional. It appears to be a product of education, not only in the human race but also for instance in chimpanzees, since4 both young children and young chimpanzees who have not been taught to fear snakes do not exhibit the alleged instinct. This example should be taken as a warning. We are faced here with an aversion which is apparently universal, even beyond the human race. But although from the fact that a habit is not universal we might perhaps argue against its being based on an instinct (but even this argument is dangerous since there are social customs enforcing the suppression of instincts), we see that the converse is certainly not true. The universal occurrence of a certain behaviour is not a decisive argument in favour of its instinctive character, or of its being rooted in ‘human nature’.

To see Marx presented in this way, that is to say, as an opponent of any psychological theory of society, may possibly surprise some Marxists as well as some anti-Marxists. For there seem to be many who believe in a very different story. Marx, they think, taught the all-pervading influence of the economic motive in the life of men; he succeeded in explaining its overpowering strength by showing that ‘man’s overmastering need was to get the means of living’1; he thus demonstrated the fundamental importance of such categories as the profit motive or the motive of class interest for the actions not only of individuals but also of social groups; and he showed how to use these categories for explaining the course of history. Indeed, they think that the very essence of Marxism is the doctrine that economic motives and especially class interest are the driving forces of history, and that it is precisely this doctrine to which the name ‘materialistic interpretation of history’ or ‘historical materialism’ alludes, a name by which Marx and Engels tried to characterize the essence of their teaching.

An important place among the various formulations of Marx’s ‘historical materialism’ is occupied by his (and Engels’) statement: ‘The history of all hitherto existing society is a history of class struggle.’1 The tendency of this statement is clear. It implies that history is propelled and the fate of man determined by the war of classes and not by the war of nations (as opposed to the views of Hegel and of the majority of historians). In the causal explanation of historical developments, including national wars, class interest must take the place of that allegedly national interest which, in reality, is only the interest of a nation’s ruling class. But over and above this, class struggle and class interest are capable of explaining phenomena which traditional history may in general not even attempt to explain. An example of such a phenomenon which is of great significance for Marxist theory is the historical trend towards increasing productivity. Even though it may perhaps record such a trend, traditional history, with its fundamental category of military power, is quite unable to explain this phenomenon. Class interest and class war, however, can explain it fully, according to Marx; indeed, a considerable part of Capital is devoted to the analysis of the mechanism by which, within the period called by Marx ‘capitalism’, an increase in productivity is brought about by these forces.

We are now ready to approach what is probably the most crucial point in our analysis as well as in our criticism of Marxism; it is Marx’s theory of the state and—paradoxical as it may sound to some—of the impotence of all politics.
Marx’s theory of the state can be presented by combining the results of the last two chapters. The legal or juridico-political system—the system of legal institutions enforced by the state—has to be understood, according to Marx, as one of the superstructures erected upon, and giving expression to, the actual productive forces of the economic system; Marx speaks1 in this connection of ‘juridical and political superstructures’. It is not, of course, the only way in which the economic or material reality and the relations between the classes which correspond to it make their appearance in the world of ideologies and ideas. Another example of such a superstructure would be, according to Marxist views, the prevailing moral system. This, as opposed to the legal system, is not enforced by state power, but sanctioned by an ideology created and controlled by the ruling class. The difference is, roughly, one between persuasion and force (as Plato2 would have said); and it is the state, the legal or political system, which uses force. It is, as Engels3 puts it, ‘a special repressive force’ for the coercion of the ruled by the rulers. ‘Political power, properly so called,’ says the Manifesto4, ‘is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing the other.’ A similar description is given by Lenin5. ‘According to Marx, the state is an organ of class domination, an organ for the oppression of one class by another; its aim is the creation of an “order” which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression …’ The state, in brief, is just part of the machinery by which the ruling class carries on its struggle.

Economic historicism is the method applied by Marx to an analysis of the impending changes in our society. According to Marx, every particular social system must destroy itself, simply because it must create the forces which produce the next historical period. A sufficiently penetrating analysis of the feudal system, undertaken shortly before the industrial revolution, might have led to the detection of the forces which were about to destroy feudalism, and to the prediction of the most important characteristics of the coming period, capitalism. Similarly, an analysis of the development of capitalism might enable us to detect the forces which work for its destruction, and to predict the most important characteristics of the new historical period which lies ahead of us. For there is surely no reason to believe that capitalism, of all social systems, will last for ever. On the contrary, the material conditions of production, and with them, the ways of human life, have never changed so quickly as they have done under capitalism. By changing its own foundations in this way, capitalism is bound to transform itself, and to produce a new period in the history of mankind.

The second step of Marx’s prophetic argument has as its most relevant premise the assumption that capitalism must lead to an increase of wealth and misery; of wealth in the numerically declining bourgeoisie, and of misery in the numerically increasing working class. This assumption will be criticized in the next chapter but is here taken for granted. The conclusions drawn from it can be divided into two parts. The first part is a prophecy concerning the development of the class structure of capitalism. It affirms that all classes apart from the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and especially the so-called middle classes, are bound to disappear, and that, in consequence of the increasing tension between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the latter will become increasingly class-conscious and united. The second part is the prophecy that this tension cannot possibly be removed, and that it will lead to a proletarian social revolution.
I believe that neither of the two conclusions follows from the premise. My criticism will be, in the main, similar to that propounded in the last chapter; that is to say, I shall try to show that Marx’s argument neglects a great number of possible developments.

According to Marxist doctrine, capitalism is labouring under inner contradictions that threaten to bring about its downfall. A minute analysis of these contradictions and of the historical movement which they force upon society constitutes the first step of Marx’s prophetic argument. This step is not only the most important of his whole theory, it is also the one on which he spent most of his labour, since practically the whole of the three volumes of Capital (over 2,200 pages in the original edition1. is devoted to its elaboration. It is also the least abstract step of the argument since it is based upon a descriptive analysis, supported by statistics, of the economic system of his time—that of unrestrained capitalism2. As Lenin puts it: ‘Marx deduces the inevitability of the transformation of capitalist society into socialism wholly and exclusively from the economic law of the movement of contemporary society.’

The arguments underlying Marx’s historical prophecy are invalid. His ingenious attempt to draw prophetic conclusions from observations of contemporary economic tendencies failed. The reason for this failure does not lie in any insufficiency of the empirical basis of the argument. Marx’s sociological and economic analyses of contemporary society may have been somewhat one-sided, but in spite of their bias, they were excellent in so far as they were descriptive. The reason for his failure as a prophet lies entirely in the poverty of historicism as such, in the simple fact that even if we observe to-day what appears to be a historical tendency or trend, we cannot know whether it will have the same appearance to-morrow.
We must admit that Marx saw many things in the right light. If we consider only his prophecy that the system of unrestrained capitalism, as he knew it, was not going to last much longer, and that its apologists who thought it would last forever were wrong, then we must say that he was right. He was right, too, in holding that it was largely the ‘class struggle’, i.e. the association of the workers, that was going to bring about its transformation into a new economic system. But we must not go so far as to say that Marx predicted that new system, interventionism1, under another name, socialism. The truth is that he had no inkling of what was lying ahead. What he called ‘socialism’ was very dissimilar from any form of interventionism, even from the Russian form; for he strongly believed that the impending development would diminish the influence, political as well as economic, of the state, while interventionism has increased it everywhere.

The task which Marx set himself in Capital was to discover inexorable laws of social development. It was not the discovery of economic laws which would be useful to the social technologist. It was neither the analysis of the economic conditions which would permit the realization of such socialist aims as just prices, equal distribution of wealth, security, reasonable planning of production and, above all, freedom, nor was it an attempt to analyse and to clarify these aims.
But although Marx was strongly opposed to Utopian technology as well as to any attempt at a moral justification of socialist aims, his writings contained, by implication, an ethical theory. This he expressed mainly by moral evaluations of social institutions. After all, Marx’s condemnation of capitalism is fundamentally a moral condemnation. The system is condemned, for the cruel injustice inherent in it which is combined with full ‘formal’ justice and righteousness. The system is condemned, because by forcing the exploiter to enslave the exploited it robs both of their freedom. Marx did not combat wealth, nor did he praise poverty. He hated capitalism, not for its accumulation of wealth, but for its oligarchical character; he hated it because in this system wealth means political power in the sense of power over other men. Labour power is made a commodity; that means that men must sell themselves on the market. Marx hated the system because it resembled slavery.

Rationality, in the sense of an appeal to a universal and impersonal standard of truth, is of supreme importance …, not only in ages in which it easily prevails, but also, and even more, in those less fortunate times in which it is despised and rejected as the vain dream of men who lack the virility to kill where they cannot agree.
BERTRAND RUSSELL.
It can hardly be doubted that Hegel’s and Marx’s historicist philosophies are characteristic products of their time—a time of social change. Like the philosophies of Heraclitus and Plato, and like those of Comte and Mill, Lamarck and Darwin, they are philosophies of change, and they witness to the tremendous and undoubtedly somewhat terrifying impression made by a changing social environment on the minds of those who live in this environment. Plato reacted to this situation by attempting to arrest all change. The more modern social philosophers appear to react very differently, since they accept, and even welcome, change; yet this love of change seems to me a little ambivalent. For even though they have given up any hope of arresting change, as historicists they try to predict it, and thus to bring it under rational control; and this certainly looks like an attempt to tame it. Thus it seems that, to the historicist, change has not entirely lost its terrors.

Marx was a rationalist. With Socrates, and with Kant, he believed in human reason as the basis of the unity of mankind. But his doctrine that our opinions are determined by class interest hastened the decline of this belief. Like Hegel’s doctrine that our ideas are determined by national interests and traditions, Marx’s doctrine tended to undermine the rationalist belief in reason. Thus threatened both from the right and from the left, a rationalist attitude to social and economic questions could hardly resist when historicist prophecy and oracular irrationalism made a frontal attack on it. This is why the conflict between rationalism and irrationalism has become the most important intellectual, and perhaps even moral, issue of our time.
Since the terms ‘reason’ and ‘rationalism’ are vague, it will be necessary to explain roughly the way in which they are used here. First, they are used in a wide sense1; they are used to cover not only intellectual activity but also observation and experiment. It is necessary to keep this remark in mind, since ‘reason’ and ‘rationalism’ are often used in a different and more narrow sense, in opposition not to ‘irrationalism’ but to ‘empiricism’; if used in this way, rationalism extols intelligence above observation and experiment, and might therefore be better described as ‘intellectualism’. But when I speak here of ‘rationalism’, I use the word always in a sense which includes ‘empiricism’ as well as ‘intellectualism’; just as science makes use of experiments as well as of thought. Secondly, I use the word ‘rationalism’ in order to indicate, roughly, an attitude that seeks to solve as many problems as possible by an appeal to reason, i.e. to clear thought and experience, rather than by an appeal to emotions and passions. This explanation, of course, is not very satisfactory, since all terms such as ‘reason’ or ‘passion’ are vague; we do not possess ‘reason’ or ‘passions’ in the sense in which we possess certain physical organs, for example, brains or a heart, or in the sense in which we possess certain ‘faculties’, for example, the power of speaking, or of gnashing our teeth. In order therefore to be a little more precise, it may be better to explain rationalism in terms of practical attitudes or behaviour. We could then say that rationalism is an attitude of readiness to listen to critical arguments and to learn from experience. It is fundamentally an attitude of admitting that ‘I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth’. It is an attitude which does not lightly give up hope that by such means as argument and careful observation, people may reach some kind of agreement on many problems of importance; and that, even where their demands and their interests clash, it is often possible to argue about the various demands and proposals, and to reach—perhaps by arbitration—a compromise which, because of its equity, is acceptable to most, if not to all. In short, the rationalist attitude, or, as I may perhaps label it, the ‘attitude of reasonableness’, is very similar to the scientific attitude, to the belief that in the search for truth we need co-operation, and that, with the help of argument, we can in time attain something like objectivity.

In approaching the end of this book, I wish again to remind the reader that these chapters were not intended as anything like a full history of historicism; they are merely scattered marginal notes to such a history, and rather personal notes to boot. That they form, besides, a kind of critical introduction to the philosophy of society and of politics, is closely connected with this character of theirs, for historicism is a social and political and moral (or, shall I say, immoral) philosophy, and it has been as such most influential since the beginning of our civilization. It is therefore hardly possible to comment on its history without discussing the fundamental problems of society, of politics, and of morals. But such a discussion, whether it admits it or not, must always contain a strong personal element. This does not mean that much in this book is purely a matter of opinion; in the few cases where I am explaining my personal proposals or decisions in moral and political matters, I have always made the personal character of the proposal or decision clear. It rather means that the selection of the subject matter treated is a matter of personal choice to a much greater extent than it would be, say, in a scientific treatise.

General Remarks. The text of the book is self-contained and may be read without these Notes. However, a considerable amount of material which is likely to interest all readers of the book will be found here, as well as some references and controversies which may not be of general interest. Readers who wish to consult the Notes for the sake of this material may find it convenient first to read without interruption through the text of a chapter, and then to turn to the Notes.
I wish to apologize for the perhaps excessive number of cross-references which have been included for the benefit of those readers who take a special interest in one or other of the side issues touched upon (such as Plato’s preoccupation with racialism, or the Socratic Problem). Knowing that war conditions would make it impossible for me to read the proofs, I decided to refer not to pages but to note numbers. Accordingly, references to the text have been indicated by notes such as: ‘cp. text to note 24 to chapter 3’, etc. War conditions also restricted library facilities, making it impossible for me to obtain a number of books, some recent and some not, which would have been consulted in normal circumstances.

Meanwhile laws and institutions require to be adapted, not to good men, but to bad.’ Much as I agree with the sentence in italics, I feel that the admission contained in the first part of the sentence is not really called for. (Cp. especially note 25 (3) to this chapter.) A similar admission may be found in an excellent passage of his Representative Government (1861; see especially p. 49) where Mill combats the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king because, especially if his rule should be a benevolent one, it will involve the ‘abdication’ of the ordinary citizen’s will, and ability, to judge a policy.

1. That Aristotle’s criticism of Plato is very frequently, and in important places, unmerited, has been admitted by many students of the history of philosophy. It is one of the few points in which even the admirers of Aristotle find it difficult to defend him, since usually they are admirers of Plato as well. Zeller, to quote just one example, comments (cp. Aristotle and the Earlier Peripatetics, English translation by Costelloe and Muirhead, 1897, II, 261, n. 2), upon the distribution of land in Aristotle’s Best State: ‘There is a similar plan in Plato’s Laws, 745c seqq.; Aristotle, however, in Politics 1265b24 considers Plato’s arrangement, merely on account of a trifling difference, highly objectionable.’ A similar remark is made by G. Grote, Aristotle (Ch. XIV, end of second paragraph). In view of many criticisms of Plato which strongly suggest that envy of Plato’s originality is part of his motive, Aristotle’s much-admired solemn assurance (Nicomachean Ethics, I, 6, 1) that the sacred duty of giving preference to truth forces him to sacrifice even what is most dear to him, namely, his love for Plato, sounds to me somewhat hypocritical.

A remark may be made concerning the term ‘concentration of capital’ (which I have translated in the text ‘concentration of capital in a few hands’).
In the third edition of Capital (cp. Capital, 689 ff.) Marx introduced the following distinctions: (a) by accumulation of capital he means merely the growth in the total amount of capital goods, for example, within a certain region; (b) by concentration of capital he means (cp. 689/690) the normal growth of the capital in the hands of the various individual capitalists, a growth which arises from the general tendency towards accumulation and which gives them command over an increasing number of workers; (c) by centralization he means (cp. 691) that kind of growth of capital which is due to the expropriation of some capitalists by other capitalists (‘one capitalist lays many of his fellows low’).

PREFACE
I tried to show, in The Poverty of Historicism, that historicism is a poor method—a method which does not bear any fruit. But I did not actually refute historicism.
Since then, I have succeeded in giving a refutation of historicism: I have shown that, for strictly logical reasons, it is impossible for us to predict the future course of history.
The argument is contained in a paper, ‘Indeterminism in Classical Physics and in Quantum Physics’, which I published in 1950. But I am no longer satisfied with this paper. A more satisfactory treatment will be found in a chapter on Indeterminism which is part of the Postscript. After Twenty Years to my Logic of Scientific Discovery.
In order to inform the reader of these more recent results, I propose to give here, in a few words, an outline of this refutation of historicism. The argument may be summed up in five statements, as follows:

Introduction
Scientific interest in social and political questions is hardly less old than scientific interest in cosmology and physics; and there were periods in antiquity (I have Plato’s political theory in mind, and Aristotle’s collection of constitutions) when the science of society might have seemed to have advanced further than the science of nature. But with Galileo and Newton, physics became successful beyond expectation, far surpassing all the other sciences; and since the time of Pasteur, the Galileo of biology, the biological sciences have been almost equally successful. But the social sciences do not as yet seem to have found their Galileo.
In these circumstances, students who work in one or another of the social sciences are greatly concerned with problems of method; and much of their discussion of these problems is conducted with an eye upon the methods of the more flourishing sciences, especially physics. It was, for instance, a conscious attempt to copy the experimental method of physics which led, in the generation of Wundt, to a reform in psychology; and since J. S. Mill, repeated attempts had been made to reform on somewhat similar lines the method of the social sciences. In the field of psychology, these reforms may have had some measure of success, despite a great many disappointments. But in the theoretical social sciences, outside economics, little else but disappointment has come from these attempts. When these failures were discussed, the question was soon raised whether the methods of physics were really applicable to the social sciences. Was it not perhaps the obstinate belief in their applicability that was responsible for the much-deplored state of these studies?

Section Title: I The Anti-Naturalistic Doctrines of Historicism - ch10
Content:
In strong opposition to methodological naturalism in the field of sociology, historicism claims that some of the characteristic methods of physics cannot be applied to the social sciences, owing to the profound differences between sociology and physics. Physical laws, or the ‘laws of nature’, it tells us, are valid anywhere and always; for the physical world is ruled by a system of physical uniformities invariable throughout space and time. Sociological laws, however, or the laws of social life, differ in different places and periods. Although historicism admits that there are plenty of typical social conditions whose regular recurrence can be observed, it denies that the regularities detectable in social life have the character of the immutable regularities of the physical world. For they depend upon history, and upon differences in culture. They depend on a particular historical situation. Thus one should not, for example, speak without further qualification of the laws of economics, but only of the economic laws of the feudal period, or of the early industrial period, and so on; always mentioning the historical period in which the laws in question are assumed to have prevailed.

Section Title: II The Pro-Naturalistic Doctrines of Historicism - ch11
Content:
Although historicism is fundamentally anti-naturalistic, it is by no means opposed to the idea that there is a common element in the methods of the physical and the social sciences. This may be due to the fact that historicists as a rule adopt the view (which I fully share) that sociology, like physics, is a branch of knowledge which aims, at the same time, to be theoretical and empirical.
By saying that it is a theoretical discipline we mean that sociology has to explain and to predict events, with the help of theories or of universal laws (which it tries to discover). By describing sociology as empirical, we mean to say that it is backed by experience, that the events it explains and predicts are observable facts, and that observation is the basis for the acceptance or rejection of any propounded theory. When we speak of success in physics we have in mind the success of its predictions: and the success of its predictions can be said to be the same as the empirical corroboration of the laws of physics. When we contrast the relative success of sociology with the success of physics, then we are assuming that success in sociology would likewise consist, basically, in the corroboration of predictions. It follows that certain methods—prediction with the help of laws, and the testing of laws by observation—must be common to physics and sociology.

19 Practical Aims of This Criticism
Whether the true motive of scientific inquiry is the desire to know, that is to say, a purely theoretical or ‘idle’ curiosity, or whether we should rather understand science as an instrument for solving the practical problems that arise in the struggle for life, this is a question that need not be decided here. It will be admitted that the defenders of the rights of ‘pure’ or ‘fundamental’ research deserve every support in their fight against the narrow view, unfortunately again fashionable, that scientific research is justified only if it proves to be a sound investment.1 But even the somewhat extreme view (to which I personally incline) that science is most significant as one of the greatest spiritual adventures that man has yet known may be combined with a recognition of the importance of practical problems and practical tests for the progress of science, whether applied or pure; for practice is invaluable for scientific speculation, both as a spur and as a bridle. One need not espouse pragmatism in order to appreciate Kant’s saying:

27 Is There a Law of Evolution? Laws and Trends
The doctrines of historicism which I have called ‘pro-naturalistic’ have much in common with its anti-naturalistic doctrines. They are, for example, influenced by holistic thinking, and they spring from a misunderstanding of the methods of the natural sciences. Since they represent a misguided effort to copy these methods, they may be described as ‘scientistic’ (in Professor Hayek’s sense1). They are just as characteristic of historicism as are its anti-naturalistic doctrines, and perhaps even more important. The belief, more especially, that it is the task of the social sciences to lay bare the law of evolution of society in order to foretell its future (a view expounded in sections 14 to 17, above) might be perhaps described as the central historicist doctrine. For it is this view of a society moving through a series of periods that gives rise, on the one hand, to the contrast between a changing social and an unchanging physical world, and thereby to anti-naturalism. On the other hand, it is the same view that gives rise to the pro-naturalistic—and scientistic—belief in so-called ‘natural laws of succession’; a belief which, in the days of Comte and Mill, could claim to be supported by the long-term predictions of astronomy, and more recently, by Darwinism. Indeed, the recent vogue of historicism might be regarded as merely part of the vogue of evolutionism—a philosophy that owes its influence largely to the somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth, and an older metaphysical theory which, incidentally, happened to be part of an established religious belief.2

Book Title: The World of Parmenides
Section Title: PREFACE - Preface
Content:
The present book contains various attempts to understand early Greek philosophy, on which I have worked for many years. I hope that these essays may illustrate the thesis that all history is, or should be, the history of problem situations, and that in following this principle we may further our understanding of the Presocratics and other thinkers of the past. The essays also try to show the greatness of the early Greek philosophers, who gave Europe its philosophy, its science, and its humanism.
The essays have not been arranged in the order in which they were written. After one of the oldest essays, ‘Back to the Presocratics’, which presents some early attempts at understanding the main interests and achievements of the Presocratics, there follow a number of essays on the central problems that Xenophanes and Parmenides may have worked on. These later essays have been rewritten many times during recent years, and only one of them (Essay 3) has been published before. They supersede in some respects ‘Back to the Presocratics’, though that essay does deal with problems partly different from the more recent ones. This should also explain why there are recurrent themes and repeated attempts at rendering the ancient Greek texts: different translations have been retained in this collection since the main themes appear in different contexts and light from essay to essay – light reflected from the splendour of Presocratic philosophy.

Aristotle’s invention of induction and the eclipse of Presocratic cosmology
With the sole exception, perhaps, of Protagoras, who seems to argue against it, all serious thinkers before Aristotle made a sharp distinction between knowledge, real knowledge, certain truth (saphes, alētheia; later: episteēmē, which is divine and only accessible to the gods, and opinion (doxa), which mortals are able to possess, and is interpreted by Xenophanes as guesswork that could be improved.
It seems that the first who revolted against this view was Protagoras. There exists the beginning of a book by him, where he says: ‘We don’t know anything about the gods – neither whether they exist, nor whether they don’t exist.’ I suggest that his homo mensura proposition – ‘Man is the measure of all things’ – is derived from this, and that his argument was as follows: ‘About the gods we don’t know anything, so we don’t know what they know. Thus human knowledge must be taken as our standard, as our measure.’ In other words, the homo mensura proposition of Protagoras is a criticism of his predecessor’s distinction between mere human opinion and divine knowledge. ‘Therefore we must take human knowledge as our standard or measure.’

Section Title: ESSAY 1 BACK TO THE PRESOCRATICS - Ch01
Content:
‘Back to Methuselah’ was a progressive programme, compared with ‘Back to Thales’ or ‘Back to Anaximander’: what Shaw offered us was an improved expectation of life – something that was in the air, at any rate when he wrote it. I have nothing to offer you, I am afraid, that is in the air today; for what I want to return to is the simple straightforward rationality of the Presocratics. Wherein does this much-discussed ‘rationality’ of the Presocratics lie? The simplicity and boldness of their questions is part of it, but my thesis is that the decisive point is the critical attitude which, as I shall try to show, was first developed in the Ionian School.
The questions which the Presocratics tried to answer were primarily cosmological questions, but there were also questions of the theory of knowledge. It is my belief that philosophy must return to cosmology and to a simple theory of knowledge. There is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested: the problem of understanding the world in which we live; and thus ourselves (who are part of that world) and our knowledge of it. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the interest of philosophy, no less than of science, lies solely in its bold attempt to add to our knowledge of the world, and to the theory of our knowledge of the world. I am interested in Wittgenstein, for example, not because of his linguistic philosophy, but because his Tractatus was a cosmological treatise (although a crude one), and because his theory of knowledge was closely linked with his cosmology.

An attempt to establish his greatness
Xenophanes … has become a figure in the history of Greek philosophy by mistake.
(Harold F. Cherniss)
Xenophanes was a poet and rhapsode, and he was a historian, perhaps the real father of history. As a highly creative thinker, unusually critical, and unique in his self-criticism, he became the founder of the Greek Enlightenment. He developed Anaximander’s cosmology in defending it against Anaximenes. His very original rationalist theology was closely connected with the cosmology that, late in life, he may have arrived at under the influence of the astronomical discoveries of Parmenides. He was a literary critic, perhaps the first, and a moralist. He was the founder of what today are called geology and meteorology. He was an acute critic, again the first, of society and of social institutions. And of decisive importance to Western science and philosophy, he was the founder of epistemology, the theory of knowledge. [Yet most, if not all, of these great contributions to our civilization have been either attributed to somebody else, ignored, partly forgotten, or simply misunderstood. In this essay I propose a more just and historically plausible picture of Xenophanes and his achievements than I think has been drawn before.]

Content:
I first met Parmenides – together with Anaximander, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and the other great Presocratics – in a German translation by Wilhelm Nestle, famous as the editor of the later editions of Zeller’s magnun opus. I was 15 or 16 years old, and I was overwhelmed by the meeting. Here were the first of the steps that led to Newton. The verses that I liked best were Parmenides’ story of Selene’s love for radiant Helios (DK 28 B14–15). But I did not like it that the translation made the Moon male and the Sun female (according to the genders of their German names), and it occurred to me to give the couplet in German a title like ‘Moongoddess and Sungod’, or perhaps ‘Selene and Helios’, in order to rectify the genders. So I began fiddling about with the translations. The volume, which I still possess, shows many traces of this.
In those days I was an enthusiastic Newtonian (I still am) and, of course, aware of the theory of the Moon. But before reading Parmenides’ story it had not occurred to me to watch how Selene always looks at Helios’ rays.

In this essay I shall not speak about the times and the personality of Parmenides of Elea, who lived about 515–445 BC, or of his influence: historical notes may be found in the Addendum to Essay 6, and elsewhere in this volume.
I shall, rather, try to solve what I believe to be the two central problems to which the extant fragments of Parmenides’ great epos give rise. It has the form of an epic poem, written in hexameters, clearly influenced by Homer. But it is a philosophical work, and probably it bore the title ‘On Nature’, thereby alluding to its predecessors, the works of the Ionian philosophers of nature, especially Anaximander and Heraclitus.
The poem consisted of two parts and an introduction (the proem). In the introduction, the young Parmenides travels by superhuman means to be received by ‘the goddess’ (probably identical with Dikē1). ‘The goddess’ announces that she will reveal to him (1) the so far unrevealed and therefore secret truth about nature or reality, but also (2) the mistaken opinions of mortal men. Then she proceeds with her speech, which is clearly divided into these two parts, usually distinguished as (1) the Way of Truth and (2) the Way of Opinion.

Section Title: ESSAY 5 CAN THE MOON THROW LIGHT ON PARMENIDES’ WAYS? (1988) - Ch05
Content:
Parmenides’ great poem, in which he expounds his view of the world, consists of a kind of prologue or introduction and two main parts, usually called ‘the Way of Truth’ and ‘the Way of Opinion’. In the prologue we learn how Parmenides meets the goddess and that she promises to reveal everything to him: both the ‘well-rounded and unshakably certain truth’ and the ‘opinions of the mortals, which are not true’ (Bl: 29–30).
The problem in the interpretation of Parmenides’ poem to which I here offer a conjectural solution is the following: why, after telling us what the real world is like in truth, and after warning us stongly against being misled by the human opinions of appearances, does Parmenides (or the goddess) proceed to describe, at great length, what it is like in appearance?
One theory that underlies Parmenides’ Two Ways is the traditional view: only the Gods know. We mortals can only guess. This is the theory of the fallibility of human opinion. We find it in Homer, in Hesiod, in Heraclitus (B82, 83), Alcmaeon (Bl), Xenophanes (B18). So this view of Parmenides is not surprising. What is surprising in Parmenides is the view that divine knowledge of reality is rational and therefore truthful, while human opinion of appearance is based upon our senses, which are not only unreliable but totally misleading.

Notes on Parmenides’ poem and its origin in early Greek cosmology
Our Western civilization is a civilization based upon science. It is a civilization based upon the science founded by Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. But the science of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton was the continuation of the cosmology of the Greeks.
It is therefore right to say that our Western civilization was founded by the Greeks. It is from them too that we have inherited the ideas of truth, of democracy, of justice, of humanity, and even of the brotherhood of men; ideas which have become all-important in the political history of Western civilization. We owe also to the Greeks our Western literature, and this was, in the beginning, closely related to science and cosmology. Literature and science both begin with story telling, with myth making, and especially with the making of cosmological myths.
I suggest that story telling or myth making is one of the earliest fruits of the emergence of specifically human language.1 Neither self-expression nor communication is specific to or characteristic of human language: for animals also express themselves, and communicate with other animals. What animals appear to be unable to do, and what men can do with the help of human language, is to tell stories; that is to say, to describe states of affairs: human language can describe actual or possible situations, actual or possible facts.2

Section Title: ESSAY 7 BEYOND THE SEARCH FOR INVARIANTS - Ch07
Content:
What unites philosophers of science – if anything does – is an insatiable interest in ideas and in their history. I mean, of course, abstract ideas: those things in whose existence Berkeley did not believe, although, being a great philosopher of science, he was as fascinated by them as any of us. Abstract ideas, that is, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, and other ‘notions’, in every state of their development, from groping and confused ideas to clearly and sharply formulated ones, are the things on which we feed, and on which we thrive.
Ideas, products and contents of thoughts, exert an almost omnipotent1 influence over human minds, and over the direction that the further evolution of ideas may take. This is quite obvious as far as religious ideas are concerned: the ideas of Buddhism or Christianity may rule over us, colouring not only our language but our thinking, every step we take, and even every observation. Yet few philosophers or scientists are aware (despite the work of Emile Meyerson, or Charles Kahn’s Anaximander) of the influence exerted by some of the oldest ideas of Greek philosophy and Greek science upon our most advanced scientific theories: upon classical physics and chemistry, relativity, quantum theory, genetics, and even molecular biology.

Content:
Human thought in general, and science in particular, are products of human history. They are, therefore, dependent on many accidents: had our history been different, our present thinking and our present science (if any) would be different also.
Arguments like these have led many people to relativistic or to sceptical conclusions. Yet these are far from inevitable. We may accept it as a fact that there are accidental (and of course irrational) elements in our thought; yet we may reject relativistic conclusions as self-defeating and as defeatist. For we may point out that we can, and sometimes do, learn from our mistakes, and that this is the way science progresses. However mistaken our starting points, they can be corrected and thus transcended; especially if we consciously seek to pin down our mistakes by criticism, as we do in the sciences. Thus scientific thought can be progressive (from a rational point of view), irrespective of its more or less accidental starting points. And we can actively help it along by criticism, and so get nearer to the truth. The scientific theories of the moment are the common product of our more or less accidental (or perhaps historically determined) prejudices, and of critical error elimination. Under the stimulus of criticism and of error elimination their truthlikeness tends to increase.

Content:
When writing on Plato in The Open Society (Chapter 6: ‘Totalitarian Justice’), I came to comment on the Platonic theory of justice and Plato’s distinction between ‘atithmetical’ equality and ‘proportionate’ (or ‘geometrical’) equality; and I appended to my note 9 of that chapter the results of a study of Plato and geometry, here reprinted in Section 1. I later added an addendum with the title ‘Plato and Geometry’, here reprinted as Section 2. After this follows Section 3, which contains Addendum II from O.S., vol. I, entitled ‘The Dating of the Theaetetus’, written in 1961. The following Sections 4 and 5 contain reprints of texts that were first published in this version in Studies in Philosophy, ed. J. N.

How induction becomes counterinduction, and the epagōgē returns to the elenchus
Already before I wrote Addendum 18 to the 7th edition of Logik der Forschung (which I still consider fatal for the philosophy of induction), that is, in the summer of 1981, I had started work on a simplification and clarification of a new proof against probabilistic induction.
I should never have found this proof without receiving a letter written to me by David Miller, my friend and collaborator. I saw immediately the importance of this letter, and I gave a short account of its content in footnote 2 on page 326 of Realism and the Aim of Science. This footnote contained, however, something that neither of us immediately saw: it turned out to be the decisive impetus for the proof, which we eventually published in Nature in April 1983.1 The present version contains a further simplification and improvement of the proof, together with some historical remarks about Aristotle and Socrates.

Section Title: APPENDIX Popper’s late fragments on Greek philosophy - Appendix
Content:
This paper continues and amplifies my first brief paper on Parmenides published in The Classical Quarterly in 1992; it was entitled ‘How the Moon Might Shed Some of her Light upon the Two Ways of Parmenides’ {Essay 3}. Here I shall refer to this earlier paper as Paper 1, and to the present one as Paper 2.
Paper 2 consists of the following sections:
Parmenides’ fragment B16 is difficult to understand. It reads, in Theophrastus’ version (with some well-known emendations), like this:
What is at any one time in their much-erring sense organs’ mixture That’s what men use as a stop-gap for thought. For they take as equal: Reasoning powers of man – and his sense organs’ nature or mixture. What in this mixture prevails, this is thinking in each man and all.
This, I hold, is a highly ironical attack on the same theory that Aristotle mentions {in his Metaphysics 1009b21} and a few lines later ascribes to Parmenides.

Section Title: POSTSCRIPT - back01
Content:
I was asked by the publishers of this book to write a short postscript, and the question was raised whether I still think as I did when I originally wrote the book in 1969, and when I wrote (on page 144) that I am the happiest philosopher I ever met.
The question refers to my optimism, to my belief that we are living in a wonderful world. This belief of mine has only become stronger. I know very well that much is wrong in our Western society. But I still have no doubt that it is the best that ever existed. And much that is wrong is due to its ruling religion. I mean the ruling religious belief that the social world we live in is a kind of hell. This religion is spread by the intellectuals, especially by those in the teaching profession and in the news media. There is almost a competition of doom and gloom: the more radically one condemns our Western society, the greater seems to be one’s chance to be listened to (and perhaps to play a leading role in it).

What to leave out and what to put in? That’s the problem.
Hugh Lofting, Doctor Dolittle’s Zoo.
When I was twenty I became apprenticed to an old master cabinetmaker in Vienna whose name was Adalbert Pösch, and I worked with him from 1922 to 1924, not long after the First World War. He looked exactly like Georges Clemenceau, but he was a very mild and kind man. After I had gained his confidence he would often, when we were alone in his workshop, give me the benefit of his inexhaustible store of knowledge. Once he told me that he had worked for many years on various models of a perpetual motion machine, adding musingly: “They say you can’t make it; but once it’s been made they’ll talk different!” (“Da sag’n s’ dass ma’ so was net mach’n kann; aber wann amal eina ein’s g’macht hat, dann wer’n s’ schon anders red’n!”) A favourite practice of his was to ask me a historical question and to answer it himself when it turned out that I did not know the answer (although I, his pupil, was a University student—a fact of which he was very proud). “And do you know”, he would ask, “who invented topboots? You don’t? It was Wallenstein, the Duke of Friedland, during the Thirty Years War.” After one or two even more difficult questions, posed by himself and triumphantly answered by himself, my master would say with modest pride: “There, you can ask me whatever you like: I know everything.” (“Da können S’ mi’ frag’n was Sie woll’n: ich weiss alles.”)

Section Title: 2. CHILDHOOD MEMORIES - ch02
Content:
Although most of us know the date and the place of our birth—mine is July 28, 1902, at a place called Himmelhof in the Ober St Veit district of Vienna—few know when and how their intellectual life began. So far as my philosophical development goes, I do remember some of its early stages. But it certainly started later than my emotional and moral development.
As a child I was, I suspect, somewhat puritanical, even priggish, though this attitude was perhaps tempered by the feeling that I had no right to sit in judgement on anybody except myself. Among my earliest memories are feelings of admiration for my elders and betters, for example for my cousin Eric Schiff, whom I greatly admired for being one year older than I, for his tidiness and, especially, for his good looks: gifts which I always regarded as important and unattainable.
One often hears it said nowadays that children are cruel by nature. I do not believe it. I was, as a child, what Americans might call a “softy”, and compassion is one of the strongest emotions I remember. It was the main component of my first experience of falling in love, which happened when I was four or five years old. I was taken to a kindergarten, and there was a beautiful little girl who was blind. My heart was torn, both by the charm of her smile and by the tragedy of her blindness. It was love at first sight. I have never forgotten her, though I saw her only once, and only for an hour or two. I was not sent to the kindergarten again; perhaps my mother noticed how much I was upset.

Section Title: 3. EARLY INFLUENCES - ch03
Content:
The atmosphere in which I was brought up was decidedly bookish. My father Dr Simon Siegmund Carl Popper, like his two brothers, was a doctor of law of the University of Vienna. He had a large library, and there were books everywhere—with the exception of the dining room, in which there was a Bösendorfer concert grand and many volumes of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms. My father, who was the same age as Sigmund Freud—whose works he possessed, and had read on publication—was a barrister and solicitor. About my mother Jenny Popper, née Schiff, I shall say more when I come to speak about music. My father was an accomplished speaker. I heard him plead in court only once, in 1924 or 1925, when I myself was the defendant. The case was, in my opinion, clear-cut.2 I had therefore not asked my father to defend me, and was embarrassed when he insisted. But the utter simplicity, clarity, and sincerity of his speech impressed me greatly.

Section Title: 4. THE FIRST WORLD WAR - ch04
Content:
I was twelve, then, when the First World War broke out; and the war years, and their aftermath, were in every respect decisive for my intellectual development. They made me critical of accepted opinions, especially political opinions.
Of course, few people knew at that time what war meant. There was a deafening clamour of patriotism throughout the country in which even some of the members of our previously far from warmongering circle participated. My father was sad and depressed. Yet even Arndt could see something hopeful. He hoped for a democratic revolution in Russia.
Afterwards I often remembered these days. Before the war, many members of our circle had discussed political theories which were decidedly pacifist, and at least highly critical of the existing order, and had been critical of the alliance between Austria and Germany, and of the expansionist policy of Austria in the Balkans, especially in Serbia. I was staggered by the fact that they could suddenly become supporters of that very policy.

Section Title: 5. AN EARLY PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM: INFINITY - ch05
Content:
I have long believed that there are genuine philosophical problems which are not mere puzzles arising out of the misuse of language. Some of these problems are childishly obvious. It so happened that I stumbled upon one of them when I was still a child, probably about eight.
Somehow I had heard about the solar system and the infinity of space (no doubt of Newtonian space) and I was worried: I could neither imagine that space was finite (for what, then, was outside it?) nor that it was infinite. My father suggested that I ask one of his brothers who, he told me, was very good at explaining such things. This uncle asked me first whether I had any trouble about a sequence of numbers going on and on. I had not. Then he asked me to imagine a stack of bricks, and to add to it one brick, and again one brick, and so on without end; it would never fill the space of the universe. I agreed, somewhat reluctantly, that this was a very helpful answer, though I was not completely happy about it. Of course, I was unable to formulate the misgivings I still felt: it was the difference between potential and actual infinity, and the impossibility of reducing the actual infinity to the potential. The problem is, of course, part (the spatial part) of Kant’s first antinomy, and it is (especially if the temporal part is added) a serious and still unsolved6 philosophical problem—especially since Einstein’s hopes of solving it by showing that the universe is a closed Riemannian space of finite radius have been more or less abandoned. It did not, of course, occur to me that what was worrying me might be an open problem. Rather, I thought that this was a question which an intelligent adult like my uncle must understand, while I was still too ignorant, or perhaps too young, or too stupid, to grasp it completely.

Section Title: 6. MY FIRST PHILOSOPHICAL FAILURE: THE PROBLEM OF ESSENTIALISM - ch06
Content:
I remember the first discussion of the first philosophical issue to become decisive for my intellectual development. The issue arose from my rejection of the attitude of attributing importance to words and their meaning (or their “true meaning”).
I must have been about fifteen. My father had suggested that I should read some of the volumes of Strindberg’s autobiography. I do not remember which of its passages prompted me, in a conversation with my father, to criticize what I felt was an obscurantist attitude of Strindberg’s: his attempt to extract something important from the “true” meanings of certain words. But I remember that when I tried to press my objections I was disturbed, indeed shocked, to find that my father did not see my point. The issue seemed obvious to me, and the more so the longer our discussion continued. When we broke it off late at night I realized that I had failed to make much impact. There was a real gulf between us on an issue of importance. I remember how, after this discussion, I tried strongly to impress on myself that I must always remember the principle of never arguing about words and their meanings, because such arguments are specious and insignificant. Moreover, I remember that I did not doubt that this simple principle must be well known and widely accepted; I suspected that both Strindberg and my father must be behind the times in these matters.

Section Title: 7. A LONG DIGRESSION CONCERNING ESSENTIALISM: WHAT STILL DIVIDES ME FROM MOST CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHERS - ch07
Content:
I call this a digression for two reasons. First, the formulation of my anti-essentialism in the third paragraph of the present section is undoubtedly biased by hindsight. Secondly, because the later parts of the present section are devoted not so much to carrying on the story of my intellectual development (though this is not neglected) as to discussing an issue which it has taken me a lifetime to clarify.
I do not wish to suggest that the following formulation was in my mind when I was fifteen, yet I cannot now state better than in this way the attitude I reached in that discussion with my father which I mentioned in the previous section:
Never let yourself be goaded into taking seriously problems about words and their meanings. What must be taken seriously are questions of fact, and assertions about facts: theories and hypotheses; the problems they solve; and the problems they raise.
In the sequel I shall refer to this piece of self-advice as my anti-essentialist exhortation. Apart from the reference to theories and hypotheses which is likely to be of a much later date, this exhortation cannot be very far from an articulation of the feelings I harboured when I first became conscious of the trap set by worries or quarrels about words and their meanings. This, I still think, is the surest path to intellectual perdition: the abandonment of real problems for the sake of verbal problems.

Section Title: 8. A CRUCIAL YEAR: MARXISM; SCIENCE AND PSEUDOSCIENCE - ch08
Content:
It was during the last terrible years of the war, probably in 1917, at a time when I was suffering from a long illness, that I realized very clearly what I had felt in my bones for a considerable time: that in our famous Austrian secondary schools (called “Gymnasium” and — horribile dictu — “Realgymnasium”) we were wasting our time shockingly, even though our teachers were well educated and tried hard to make the schools the best in the world. That much of their teaching was boring in the extreme—hours and hours of hopeless torture—was not new to me. (They immunized me: never since have I suffered from boredom. In school one was liable to be found out if one thought of something unconnected with the lesson: one was compelled to attend. Later on, when a lecturer was boring, one could entertain oneself with one’s own thoughts.) There was just one subject in which we had an interesting and truly inspiring teacher. The subject was mathematics, and the name of the teacher was Philipp Freud (I do not know whether he was a relative of Sigmund Freud’s). Yet when I returned to school after an illness of over two months I found that my class had made hardly any progress, not even in mathematics. This was an eye-opener: it made me eager to leave school.

Section Title: 9. EARLY STUDIES - ch09
Content:
Although the years after the First World War were grim for most of my friends and also for myself, it was an exhilarating time. Not that we were happy. Most of us had no prospects and no plans. We lived in a very poor country in which civil war was endemic, flaring up in earnest from time to time. We were often depressed, discouraged, disgusted. But we were learning, our minds were active and growing. We were reading ravenously, omnivorously; debating, changing our opinions, studying, sifting critically, thinking. We listened to music, went tramping in the beautiful Austrian mountains, and dreamt of a better, healthier, simpler, and more honest world.
During the winter of 1919–20 I left home to live in a disused part of a former military hospital converted by students into an extremely primitive students’ home. I wanted to be independent, and I tried not to be a burden to my father, who was well over sixty and had lost all his savings in the runaway inflation after the war. My parents would have preferred me to stay at home.

Section Title: 10. A SECOND DIGRESSION: DOGMATIC AND CRITICAL THINKING; LEARNING WITHOUT INDUCTION - ch10
Content:
Konrad Lorenz is the author of a marvellous theory in the field of animal psychology, which he calls “imprinting”. It implies that young animals have an inborn mechanism for jumping to unshakable conclusions. For example, a newly hatched gosling adopts as its “mother” the first moving thing it sets eyes on. This mechanism is well adapted to normal circumstances, though a bit risky for the gosling. (It may also be risky for the chosen foster parent, as we learn from Lorenz.) But it is a successful mechanism under normal circumstances; and also under some which are not quite normal.
The following points about Lorenz’s “imprinting” are important:
(1) It is a process—not the only one—of learning by observation.
(2) The problem solved under the stimulus of the observation is inborn; that is, the gosling is genetically conditioned to look out for its mother: it expects to see its mother.

Section Title: 11. MUSIC - ch11
Content:
In all this, speculations about music played a considerable part, especially during my apprenticeship.
Music has been a dominant theme in my life. My mother was very musical: she played the piano beautifully. It seems that music is a thing that runs in families, though why this should be so is very puzzling indeed. European music seems much too recent an invention to be genetically based, and primitive music is a thing which many very musical people dislike as much as they love the music written since Dunstable, Dufay, Josquin des Prés, Palestrina, Lassus, and Byrd.
However this may be, my mother’s family was “musical”. It may have come down through my maternal grandmother, née Schlesinger. (Bruno Walter was a member of the Schlesinger family. I was not, in fact, an admirer of his, especially after singing under his direction in Bach’s St Matthew Passion.) My grandparents Schiff were both founder-members of the famous Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, which built the beautiful Musikvereinssaal in Vienna. Both my mother’s sisters played the piano very well. The elder sister was a professional pianist, whose three children were also gifted musicians—as were three other cousins of mine on my mother’s side. One of her brothers played, for many years, first violin in an excellent quartet.

Section Title: 12. SPECULATIONS ABOUT THE RISE OF POLYPHONIC MUSIC: PSYCHOLOGY OF DISCOVERY OR LOGIC OF DISCOVERY? - ch12
Content:
The speculations which I shall recount briefly here were closely related to my speculations, reported earlier, on dogmatic and critical thinking. I believe they were among my earliest attempts to apply those psychological ideas to another field; later they led me to an interpretation of the rise of Greek science. The ideas on Greek science I found to be historically fruitful; those on the rise of polyphony may well be historically mistaken. I later chose the history of music as a second subject for my Ph. D. examination, in the hope that this would give me an opprotunity to investigate whether there was anything in them, but I did not get anywhere and my attention soon turned to other problems. In fact, I have now forgotten almost everything I ever knew in this field. Yet these ideas later greatly influenced my reinterpretation of Kant and my change of interest from the psychology of discovery to an objectivist epistemology—that is, to the logic of discovery.
My problem was this. Polyphony, like science, is peculiar to our Western civilization. (I am using the term “polyphony” to denote not only counterpoint but also Western harmony.) Unlike science it does not seem to be of Greek origin but to have arisen between the ninth and fifteenth centuries A.D. If so, it is possibly the most unprecedented, original, indeed miraculous achievement of our Western civilization, not excluding science.

Section Title: 13. TWO KINDS OF MUSIC - ch13
Content:
It was my interest in music that led me to what I then felt was a minor intellectual discovery (in 1920, I should say, even before the rise of my interest in the psychology of discovery described in the preceding section and in section 10). This discovery later greatly influenced my ways of thinking in philosophy, and it ultimately led even to my distinction between world 2 and world 3, which plays such a role in the philosophy of my old age. At first it took the form of an interpretation of the difference between Bach’s and Beethoven’s music, or their ways of approaching music. I still think that there is something in my idea, even though this particular interpretation, I later thought, greatly exaggerated the difference between Bach and Beethoven. Yet the origin of this intellectual discovery is for me so closely connected with these two great composers that I will relate it in the form in which it occurred to me at the time. I do not wish to suggest, however, that my remarks do justice to them or to other composers, or that they add something new to the many things, good and bad, which have been written about music: my remarks are essentially autobiographical.

Section Title: 14. PROGRESSIVISM IN ART, ESPECIALLY IN MUSIC - ch14
Content:
I certainly was not quite just when I thought that Beethoven was responsible for the rise of expressionism in music. No doubt he was influenced by the romantic movement, but we can see from his notebooks that he was far removed from merely expressing his feelings or his whims. He often worked very hard through version after version of an idea, trying to clarify and to simplify it, as a comparison of the Choral Fantasy with the notebooks for his Ninth Symphony will show. And yet, the indirect influence of his tempestuous personality, and the attempts to emulate him led, I believe, to a decline in music. It still seems to me that this decline was brought about largely by expressionist theories of music. But I would not now contend that there are not other equally pernicious creeds, and among them some anti-expressionist creeds, which have led to all kinds of formalistic experiments, from serialism to musique concrète. All these movements, however, and especially the “anti-” movements, largely result from that brand of “historicism” which I will discuss in this section, and especially from the historicist attitude towards “progress”.

Section Title: 15. LAST YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY - ch15
Content:
In 1925, while I was working with neglected children, the City of Vienna founded a new institute of education, called the Pedagogic Institute. The Institute was to be linked, somewhat loosely, with the University. It was to be autonomous, but its students were to take courses at the University in addition to the courses at the Institute. Some of the University courses (such as psychology) were made compulsory by the Institute, others were left to the choice of the students. The purpose of the new Institute was to further and support the reform, then in progress, of the primary and secondary schools in Vienna, and some social workers were admitted as students; I was among them. So also were some lifelong friends of mine—Fritz Kolb, who after the Second World War served as Austrian Ambassador in Pakistan, and Robert Lammer, with both of whom I enjoyed many fascinating discussions.
This meant that after a short period as social workers we had to give up our work (without unemployment relief, or income of any kind—except, in my case, the occasional coaching of American students). But we were enthusiastic for school reform, and enthusiastic for studying—even though our experience with neglected children made some of us sceptical of the educational theories we had to swallow in huge doses. These were imported mainly from America (John Dewey) and from Germany (Georg Kerschensteiner).

Content:
I got my Ph.D. in 1928, and in 1929 I qualified as a teacher of mathematics and physical science in (lower) secondary schools. For this qualifying examination I wrote a thesis on problems of axiomatics in geometry, which also contained a chapter on non-Euclidean geometry.
It was only after my Ph.D. examination that I put two and two together, and my earlier ideas fell into place. I understood why the mistaken theory of science which had ruled since Bacon—that the natural sciences were the inductive sciences, and that induction was a process of establishing or justifying theories by repeated observations or experiments—was so deeply entrenched. The reason was that scientists had to demarcate their activities from pseudoscience as well as from theology and metaphysics, and they had taken over from Bacon the inductive method as their criterion of demarcation. (On the other hand, they were anxious to justify their theories by an appeal to sources of knowledge comparable in reliability to the sources of religion.) But I had held in my hands for many years a better criterion of demarcation: testability or falsifiability.

Section Title: 17. WHO KILLED LOGICAL POSITIVISM? - ch17
Content:
Logical positivism, then, is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes.
John Passmore110
Owing to the manner in which it originated, my book Logik der Forschung, published late in 1934, was cast partly in the form of a criticism of positivism. So were its unpublished predecessor of 1932 and my brief letter to the Editors of Erkenntnis in 1933.111 Since at this time my position was being widely discussed by leading members of the Circle and, moreover, since the book was published in a mainly positivistic series edited by Frank and Schlick, this aspect of Logik der Forschung had some curious consequences. One was that until its English publication in 1959 as The Logic of Scientific Discovery philosophers in England and America (with only a few exceptions, such as J. R. Weinberg)112 seem to have taken me for a logical positivist—or at best for a dissenting logical positivist who replaced verifiability by falsifiability.113 Even some logical positivists themselves, remembering that the book had come out in this series, preferred to see in me an ally rather than a critic.113a They thought they could ward off my criticism with a few concessions—preferably mutual ones—and some verbal stratagems.114 (For example, they persuaded themselves that I would agree to substitute falsifiability for verifiability as a criterion of meaningfulness.) And because I did not press my attack home (fighting logical positivism being by no means a major interest of mine) the logical positivists did not feel that logical positivism was seriously challenged. Before, and even after, the Second World War books and papers went on appearing which continued this method of concessions and small adjustments. But by then logical positivism had really been dead some years.

Section Title: 18. REALISM AND QUANTUM THEORY - ch18
Content:
Although my Logik der Forschung may have looked to some like a criticism of the Vienna Circle, its main aims were positive. I tried to propound a theory of human knowledge. But I looked upon human knowledge in a way quite different from the way of the classical philosophers. Down to Hume and Mill and Mach, most philosophers took human knowledge as something settled. Even Hume, who thought of himself as a sceptic, and who wrote the Treatise in the hope of revolutionizing the social sciences, almost identified human knowledge with human habits. Human knowledge was what almost everybody knew: that the cat was on the mat; that Julius Caesar had been assassinated; that grass was green. All this seemed to me incredibly uninteresting. What was interesting was problematic knowledge, growth of knowledge—discovery.
If we are to look upon the theory of knowledge as a theory of discovery, then it will be best to look at scientific discovery. A theory of the growth of knowledge should have something to say especially about the growth of physics, and about the clash of opinions in physics.

Section Title: 19. OBJECTIVITY AND PHYSICS - ch19
Content:
In the preceding section I stressed some aspects of Logik der Forschung and of later work that emerged from it, which had little or nothing to do with my criticism of positivism. However, the criticism of positivism did play a subsidiary role even in my views on quantum theory. I think I was immunized against Heisenberg’s early positivism by my rejection of Einstein’s positivism.
As I mentioned before (section 8, text between notes 31 and 32), I was introduced to Einstein’s theories of relativity by Max Elstein. He neither stressed nor criticized the observational point of view, but helped me to understand the problem of the special theory (I am afraid in the usual unhistorical manner, as a problem posed by the experiment of Michelson and Morley), and he discussed with me Minkowski’s form of the solution. It may have been this initiation that prevented me from ever taking the operationalist approach to simultaneity seriously: one can read Einstein’s paper143 of 1905 as a realist, without paying any attention to “the observer”; or alternatively, one can read it as a positivist or operationalist, always attending to the observer and his doings.

Section Title: 20. TRUTH; PROBABILITY; CORROBORATION - ch20
Content:
By the time Logik der Forschung was published I felt that there were three problems which I had to take further: truth, probability, and the comparison of theories with respect to their content and to their corroboration.
Although the notion of falsity—that is, of untruth—and thus, by implication, the notion of truth—played a big role in Logik der Forschung, I had used it quite naively, and had discussed it only in section 84, entitled “Remarks Concerning the Use of the Concepts ‘True’ and ‘Corroborated’ ” (Bemerkungen über den Gebrauch der Begriffe “wahr” und “bewährt”). At the time I did not know Tarski’s work, or the distinction between two kinds of metalinguistic theories (one called by Carnap “Syntax”, and the other by Tarski “Semantics”, later very clearly distinguished and discussed by Marja Kokoszynska);147 yet so far as the relation between truth and corroboration was concerned, my views148 became more or less standard in the Circle—that is, among those of its members149 who, like Carnap, accepted Tarski’s theory of truth.

Section Title: 21. THE APPROACHING WAR; THE JEWISH PROBLEM - ch21
Content:
It was in July, 1927, after the big shooting in Vienna, described below, that I began to expect the worst: that the democratic bastions of Central Europe would fall, and that a totalitarian Germany would start another world war. By about 1929 I realized that among the politicians of the West only Churchill in England, then an outsider whom nobody took seriously, understood the German menace. I then thought that the war would come in a few years. I was mistaken: everything developed much more slowly than I thought possible, considering the logic of the situation.
Obviously, I was an alarmist. But essentially I had judged the situation correctly. I realized that the social democrats (the only remaining political party with a strong democratic element) were powerless to resist the totalitarian parties in Austria and Germany. I expected, from 1929 on, the rise of Hitler; I expected the annexation, in some form or other, of Austria by Hitler; and I expected the War against the West. (The War Against the West is the title of an excellent book by Aurel Kolnai.) In these expectations my assessment of the Jewish problem played a considerable role.

Content:
My Logik der Forschung was surprisingly successful, far beyond Vienna. There were more reviews, in more languages, than there were twenty-five years later of The Logic of Scientific Discovery, and fuller reviews even in English. As a consequence I received many letters from various countries in Europe and many invitations to lecture, including an invitation from Professor Susan Stebbing of Bedford College, London. I came to England in the autumn of 1935 to give two lectures at Bedford College. I had been invited to speak about my own ideas, but I was so deeply impressed by Tarski’s achievements, then completely unknown in England, that I chose them as my topic instead. My first lecture was on “Syntax and Semantics” (Tarski’s semantics) and the second on Tarski’s theory of truth. I believe that it was on this occasion that I first aroused the interest of Professor Joseph Henry Woodger, the biologist and philosopher of biology, in Tarski’s work.162 Altogether I paid in 1935–36 two long visits to England with a very short stay in Vienna between them. I was on leave of absence without pay from my teaching job, while my wife continued to teach, and to earn.

Before we went to New Zealand I had stayed in England, in all for about nine months, and it had been a revelation and an inspiration. The honesty and decency of the people and their strong feeling of political responsibility made the greatest possible impression on me. But even the university teachers I met were utterly misinformed about Hitler’s Germany, and wishful thinking was universal. I was in England when popular loyalty to the ideas of the League of Nations destroyed the Hoare-Laval plan (which might well have prevented Mussolini from joining forces with Hitler); and I was there when Hitler entered the Rhineland, an act supported by an upsurge of English popular opinion. I also heard Neville Chamberlain speak in favour of a rearmament budget, and I tried to comfort myself with the idea that he was only Chancellor of the Exchequer, and that there was therefore no real need for him to understand what he was arming against, or how urgent it all was. I realized that democracy—even British democracy—was not an institution designed to fight totalitarianism; but it was very sad to find that there was apparently only one man—Winston Churchill—who understood what was happening, and that literally nobody had a good word for him.

Content:
Originally I simply intended to elaborate and to put into publishable English my talk in Hayek’s seminar (first given in German in Brussels in the house of my friend Alfred Braunthal),170 showing more closely how “historicism” inspired both Marxism and fascism. I saw the finished paper clearly before me: a fairly long paper, but of course easily publishable in one piece.
My main trouble was to write it in acceptable English. I had written a few things before, but they were linguistically very bad. My German style in Logik der Forschung had been reasonably light—for German readers; but I discovered that English standards of writing were utterly different, and far higher than German standards. For example, no German reader minds polysyllables. In English, one has to learn to be repelled by them. But if one is still fighting to avoid the simplest mistakes, such higher aims are far more distant, however much one may approve of them.

Section Title: 26. ENGLAND: AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE - ch26
Content:
Wartime conditions were still prevailing when we left New Zealand, and our boat was ordered to sail round Cape Horn: This was a fantastically and unforgettably beautiful sight. We arrived in England early in January, 1946, and I started work at the London School of Economics.
The L.S.E. was in those days, just after the war, a marvellous institution. It was small enough for everybody on the staff to know everybody else. The staff, though few, were outstanding, and so were the students. There were lots of them—larger classes than I had later at the L.S.E.—eager, mature, and extremely appreciative; and they presented a challenge to the teacher. Among these students was a former regular officer of the Royal Navy, John Watkins, now my successor at the L.S.E.
I had come back from New Zealand with lots of open problems, in part purely logical, in part matters of method, including the method of the social sciences; and being now in a school of the social sciences, I felt that those latter problems had—for a time—a claim on me prior to problems of method in the natural sciences. Yet the social sciences never had for me the same attraction as the theoretical natural sciences. In fact, the only theoretical social science which appealed to me was economics. But like many before me I was interested to compare the natural and the social sciences from the point of view of their methods, which was to some extent a continuation of work I had done in The Poverty.

Section Title: 27. EARLY WORK IN ENGLAND - ch27
Content:
Although I have known sorrow and great sadness, as is everybody’s lot, I do not think that I have had an unhappy hour as a philosopher since we returned to England. I have worked hard, and I have often got deep into insoluble difficulties. But I have been most happy in finding new problems, in wrestling with them, and in making some progress. This, or so I feel, is the best life. It seems to me infinitely better than the life of mere contemplation (to say nothing of divine self-contemplation) which Aristotle recommends as the best. It is a completely restless life, but it is highly self-contained—autark in Plato’s sense, although no life, of course, can be fully autark. Neither my wife nor I liked living in London; but ever since we moved to Penn in Buckinghamshire, in 1950, I have been, I suspect, the happiest philosopher I have met.
This is far from irrelevant to my intellectual development since it has helped me immensely in my work. But there is also some feedback here: one of the many great sources of happiness is to get a glimpse, here and there, of a new aspect of the incredible world we live in, and of our incredible role in it.

Section Title: 28. FIRST VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES: MEETING EINSTEIN - ch28
Content:
In 1949 I received an invitation to give the William James Lectures at Harvard. This led to my first visit to America, and it made a tremendous difference to my life. When I read Professor Donald Williams’s most unexpected letter of invitation I thought a mistake had been made: I thought I had been invited in the belief that I was Joseph Popper-Lynkeus.
I was at that time working on three things: a series of papers on natural deduction; various axiomatizations of probability; and the methodology of social science. The only topic which seemed to fit a course of eight or ten public lectures was the last of these, and so I chose as the title of the lectures “The Study of Nature and of Society”.
We sailed in February, 1950. Of the members of the department of philosophy at Harvard I had met only Quine before. Now I also met C. I. Lewis, Donald Williams, and Morton White. I also met again, for the first time since 1936, a number of old friends: the mathematician Paul Boschan, Herbert Feigl, Philipp Frank (who introduced me to the great physicist Percy Bridgman, with whom I quickly became friends), Julius Kraft, Richard von Mises, Franz Urbach, Abraham Wald, and Victor Weisskopf. I also met, for the first time, Gottfried von Haberler who, as I later heard from Hayek, had apparently been the first economist to become interested in my theory of method; George Sarton and I. Bernard Cohen, the historians of science; and James Bryant Conant, the President of Harvard.

Already in 1937, when trying to make sense of the famous “dialectic triad” (thesis: antithesis: synthesis) by interpreting it as a form of the method of trial and error-elimination, I suggested that all scientific discussions start with a problem (P1), to which we offer some sort of tentative solution—a tentative theory (TT); this theory is then criticized, in an attempt at error elimination (EE); and as in the case of dialectic, this process renews itself: the theory and its critical revision give rise to new problems (P2).209
Later, I condensed this into the following schema:

Section Title: 30. DEBATES WITH SCHRÖDINGER - ch30
Content:
It was in 1947 or 1948 that Schrödinger let me know that he was coming to London, and I met him in the mews house of one of his friends. From then on we were in fairly regular contact by way of letters, and by personal meetings in London, and later in Dublin, in Alpbach, Tyrol, and in Vienna.
In 1960 I was in hospital in Vienna, and as he was too ill to come to the hospital, his wife, Annemarie Schrödinger, came to see me every day. Before I returned to England I visited them in their apartment in the Pasteurgasse. It was the last time I saw him.
Our relations had been somewhat stormy. Nobody who knew him will be surprised at this. We disagreed violently on many things. Originally I had taken it almost for granted that he, with his admiration for Boltzmann, would not hold a positivist epistemology, but our most violent clash was sparked off when I criticized one day (in 1954 or 1955 approximately) the Machian view now usually called “neutral monism”—even though we both agreed that, contrary to Mach’s intentions, this doctrine was a form of idealism.212

Section Title: 31. OBJECTIVITY AND CRITICISM - ch31
Content:
Much of my work in recent years has been in defence of objectivity, attacking or counterattacking subjectivist positions.
To start with, I must make it quite clear that I am not a behaviourist, and my defence of objectivity has nothing to do with any denial of “introspective methods” in psychology. I do not deny the existence of subjective experiences, of mental states, of intelligences, and of minds; I even believe these to be of the utmost importance. But I think that our theories about these subjective experiences, or about these minds, should be as objective as other theories. And by an objective theory I mean a theory which is arguable, which can be exposed to rational criticism, preferably a theory which can be tested: one which does not merely appeal to our subjective intuitions.
As an example of some simple testable laws about subjective experiences I might mention optical illusions such as the Müller-Lyer illusion. An interesting optical illusion was recently shown to me by my friend Edgar Tranekjaer Rasmussen: if a swinging pendulum—a weight suspended from a string—is observed by placing a dark glass before one eye it appears, in binocular vision, to move round a horizontal circle rather than in a vertical plane; and if the dark glass is placed before the other eye, it appears to move round the same circle in the opposite direction.

Section Title: 32. INDUCTION; DEDUCTION; OBJECTIVE TRUTH - ch32
Content:
There is perhaps a need here for a few words about the myth of induction, and about some of my arguments against induction. And since at present the most fashionable forms of the myth connect induction with an untenable subjectivist philosophy of deduction, I must first say a little more about the objective theory of deductive inference, and about the objective theory of truth.
I did not originally intend to explain Tarski’s theory of objective truth in this Autobiography; but after writing briefly about it in section 20 I happened to come across some evidence showing that certain logicians have not understood the theory in the sense in which I think it should be understood. As the theory is needed to explain the fundamental difference between deductive inference and the mythical inductive inference, I will explain it briefly. I shall begin with the following problem.
How can one ever hope to understand what is meant by saying that a statement (or a “meaningful sentence”, as Tarski calls it)224 corresponds to the facts? Indeed, it seems that unless one accepts something like a picture theory of language (as did Wittgenstein in the Tractatus) one cannot speak of anything like correspondence between a statement and a fact. But the picture theory is hopelessly and indeed outrageously mistaken, and so there seems to be no prospect of explaining the correspondence of a statement to a fact.

Content:
After the publication of The Open Society in 1945 my wife pointed out to me that this book did not represent my central philosophical interests, for I was not primarily a political philosopher. I had in fact said so in the Introduction; but she was satisfied neither by this disclaimer, nor by my subsequent return to my old interests, to the theory of scientific knowledge. She pointed out to me that my Logik der Forschung had long been unobtainable and by then was very nearly forgotten; and that, since I was assuming its results in my new writings, it had become urgent that it should be translated into English. I quite agreed with her, but without her insistent reminders, through many years, I should have let it rest; even so it took another fourteen years for The Logic of Scientific Discovery to be published (in 1959) and another seven years for the second German edition of Logik der Forschung.

Content:
Few great men have had an intellectual impact upon the twentieth century comparable to that of Ernst Mach. He influenced physics, physiology, psychology, the philosophy of science, and pure (or speculative) philosophy. He influenced Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, William James, Bertrand Russell—to mention just a few names. Mach was not a great physicist; but he was a great personality and a great historian and philosopher of science. As a physiologist, psychologist, and philosopher of science, he held many important and original views to which I subscribe. He was, for instance, an evolutionist in the theory of knowledge, and in the field of psychology and physiology, especially in the study of the senses. He was critical of metaphysics, but he was sufficiently tolerant to admit, and even to stress, the necessity of metaphysical ideas as guiding lights for the physicist, even the experimental physicist. Thus he wrote, in his Principles of the Theory of Heat, about Joule:244

Book Title: Unended Quest
Section Title: 35. BOLTZMANN AND THE ARROW OF TIME - ch35
Content:
The irruption of subjectivism into physics—and especially into the theory of time and entropy—began long before the rise of quantum mechanics. It was closely connected with the tragedy of Ludwig Boltzmann, one of the great physicists of the nineteenth century, and at the same time an ardent and almost militant realist and objectivist.
Boltzmann and Mach were colleagues at the University of Vienna. Boltzmann was professor of physics there when Mach was called, in 1895, to a chair in the philosophy of science, established especially for him. It must have been the first chair of its kind in the world. Later Mortiz Schlick occupied the chair, and after him Victor Kraft.252 In 1901, when Mach resigned, Boltzmann succeeded him, keeping his chair of physics, Mach, who was Boltzmann’s senior by six years, stayed in Vienna approximately until Boltzmann’s death in 1906; and during this period, and for many years after, Mach’s influence was constantly increasing. Both were physicists, Boltzmann by far the more brilliant and creative of the two;253 and both were philosophers. Mach was called to Vienna as a philosopher, on the initiative of two philosophers. (Boltzmann was called to succeed Stefan in a chair of physics—a chair of which Mach had had some hopes. The idea of calling Mach instead to a chair of philosophy originated with Heinrich Gomperz, then only twenty-one, who took action through his father.)254 On the philosophical merits of Boltzmann and Mach my judgement is frankly partisan. Boltzmann is little known as a philosopher; until quite recently I too knew next to nothing about his philosophy, and I still know much less about it than I should. Yet with what I know I agree; more closely perhaps than with any other philosophy. Thus I greatly prefer Boltzmann to Mach—not only as a physicist and a philosopher but also, I admit, as a person. But I also find Mach’s personality extremely attractive; and although I am utterly opposed to his “Analysis of Sensations”, I agree with his biological approach to the problem of (subjective) knowledge.

Section Title: 36. THE SUBJECTIVIST THEORY OF ENTROPY - ch36
Content:
What I mean here by the subjectivist theory of entropy265 is not Boltzmann’s theory, in which the arrow of time is subjective but entropy objective. I mean rather a theory, originally due to Leo Szilard,266 according to which the entropy of a system increases whenever our information about it decreases, and vice versa. According to Szilard’s theory, any gain of information or knowledge must be interpreted as a decrease in entropy: in accordance with the second law it must somehow be paid for by an at least equal increase in entropy.267
I admit that there is something intuitively satisfying in this thesis—especially, of course, for a subjectivist. Undoubtedly, information (or “informative content”) can be measured by improbability, as in fact I pointed out in 1934 in my Logik der Forschung.268 Entropy, on the other hand, can be equated with the probability of the state of the system in question. Thus the following equations appear to be valid:

Section Title: 37. DARWINISM AS A METAPHYSICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMME - ch37
Content:
I have always been extremely interested in the theory of evolution, and very ready to accept evolution as a fact. I have also been fascinated by Darwin as well as by Darwinism—though somewhat unimpressed by most of the evolutionary philosophers; with the one great exception, that is, of Samuel Butler.276
My Logik der Forschung contained a theory of the growth of knowledge by trial and error-elimination, that is, by Darwinian selection rather than Lamarckian instruction; this point (at which I hinted in that book) increased, of course, my interest in the theory of evolution. Some of the things I shall have to say spring from an attempt to utilize my methodology and its resemblance to Darwinism to throw light on Darwin’s theory of evolution.
The Poverty of Historicism277 contains my first brief attempt to deal with some epistemological questions connected with the theory of evolution. I continued to work on such problems, and I was greatly encouraged when I later found that I had come to results very similar to some of Schrödinger’s.278

Book Title: Unended Quest
Section Title: 38. WORLD 3 OR THE THIRD WORLD - ch38
Content:
In his Wissenschaftslehre, Bolzano spoke of “truths in themselves” and, more generally, of “statements in themselves”, in contradistinction to those (subjective) thought processes by which a man may think, or grasp truths; or, more generally, grasp statements, either true or false.
Bolzano’s distinction between statements in themselves and subjective thought processes has always seemed to me of the greatest importance. Statements in themselves can stand in logical relations to each other: one statement can follow from another, and statements can be logically compatible or incompatible. Subjective thought processes, on the other hand, can only stand in psychological relations. They can disquieten us or comfort us, can remind us of some experiences or suggest to us certain expectations; they can induce us to take some action, or to leave some planned action undone.
The two kinds of relations are utterly different. One man’s thought processes can neither contradict those of another man, nor his own thought processes at some other time; but the contents of his thoughts—that is, the statements in themselves—can of course contradict the contents of another man’s thoughts. On the other hand, contents, or statements in themselves, cannot stand in psychological relations: thoughts in the sense of contents or statements in themselves and thoughts in the sense of thought processes belong to two entirely different “worlds”.

Section Title: 39. THE BODY-MIND PROBLEM AND WORLD 3 - ch39
Content:
I think that I was always a Cartesian dualist (although I never thought that we should talk about “substances”298); and if not a dualist, I was certainly more inclined to pluralism than to monism. I think it silly or at least high-handed to deny the existence of mental experiences or mental states or states of consciousness; or to deny that mental states are as a rule closely related to states of the body, especially physiological states. But it also seems clear that mental states are products of the evolution of life, and that little can be gained by linking them to physics rather than to biology.299
My earliest encounters with the body-mind problem made me feel, for many years, that it was a hopeless problem. Psychology, qua science of the self and its experiences, was almost nonexistent, pace Freud. Watson’s behaviourism was a very understandable reaction to this state of affairs, and it had some methodical advantages—like so many other theories which deny what they cannot explain. As a philosophical thesis it was clearly wrong, even though irrefutable. That we do experience joy and sadness, hope and fear, not to mention a toothache, and that we do think, in words as well as by means of schemata; that we can read a book with more or less interest and attention—all this seemed to me obviously true, though easily denied; and extremely important, though obviously nondemonstrable. It also seemed to me quite obvious that we are embodied selves or minds or souls. But how can the relation between our bodies (or physiological states) and our minds (or mental states) be rationally understood? This question seemed to formulate the body-mind problem; and as far as I could see there was no hope of doing anything to bring it nearer to a solution.

Section Title: 40. THE PLACE OF VALUES IN A WORLD OF FACTS - ch40
Content:
The title of this section is close to that of a book by a great psychologist and a great man, Wolfgang Köhler.306 I found his formulation of the problem in the first chapter of his book not only admirably put but very moving; and I think it will move not merely those who remember the times in which the book was written.307 Yet I was disappointed by Köhler’s own solution of his problem, What is the place of values in the world of facts; and how could they make their entry into this world of facts? I feel unconvinced by his thesis that Gestalt psychology can make an important contribution to the solution of this problem.
Köhler explains very clearly why few scientists, and few philosophers with scientific training, care to write about values. The reason is simply that so much of the talk about values is just hot air. So many of us fear that we too would only produce hot air or, if not that, something not easily distinguished from it. To me these fears seem to be well founded, in spite of Köhler’s efforts to convince us that we should be bold and run the risk. At least in the field of ethical theory (I do not include the Sermon on the Mount) with its almost infinite literature, I cannot recall having read anything good and striking except Plato’s Apology of Socrates (in which ethical theory plays a subsidiary role), some of Kant’s works, especially his Foundations of the Metaphysic of Morals (which is not too successful) and Friedrich Schiller’s elegiac couplets which wittily criticize Kant’s rigorism.308 Perhaps I might add to this list Schopenhauer’s Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics. Except Plato’s Apology, and Schiller’s charming reductio of Kant, none of these come anywhere near to achieving their aim.

1 The allusion is to Kierkegaard’s conversation with Christian VIII in which the King asked him for his views on how a King should conduct himself. Kierkegaard said such things as: “First, it would be a good thing for the King to be ugly.” (Christian VIII was very good-looking.) “Then he should be deaf and blind, or at least behave as if he were, for this solves many difficulties…. And then, he must not say much, but must have a little standard speech that can be used on all occasions, a speech therefore without content.” (Francis Joseph used to say: “It was very nice, and it pleased me very much.”—“Es war sehr schön, es hat mich sehr gefreut.”)
2 The case arose from my work with children. One of the boys for whom I was responsible had fallen from a climbing frame and had suffered a fractured skull. I was acquitted because I could prove that I had demanded for months that the authorities should remove the climbing frame, which I regarded as dangerous. (The authorities had tried to put the blame on me; a procedure about which the judge had some strong words to say.)

A Summary by Way of a Preface
All things living are in search of a better world.
Men, animals, plants, even unicellular organisms are constantly active. They are trying to improve their situation, or at least to avoid its deterioration. Even when asleep, the organism is actively maintaining the state of sleep: the depth (or else the shallowness) of sleep is a condition actively created by the organism, which sustains sleep (or else keeps the organism on the alert). Every organism is constantly preoccupied with the task of solving problems. These problems arise from its own assessments of its condition and of its environment; conditions which the organism seeks to improve.
An attempted solution often proves to be misguided, in that it makes things worse. Then follow further attempts at solutions – further trial and error movements.
We can see that life – even at the level of the unicellular organism – brings something completely new into the world, something that did not previously exist: problems and active attempts to solve them; assessments, values; trial and error.

Knowledge and the Shaping of Reality
The Search for a Better World
The first half of the title of my lecture was not chosen by me, but by the organizers of the Alpbach Forum. Their title was: ‘Knowledge and the Shaping of Reality’.
My lecture consists of three parts: knowledge; reality; and the shaping of reality through knowledge. The second part, which deals with reality, is by far the longest, since it contains a great deal by way of preparation for the third part.
1. Knowledge
I shall start with knowledge. We live in a time in which irrational-ism has once more become fashionable. Consequently, I want to begin by declaring that I regard scientific knowledge as the best and most important kind of knowledge we have – though I am far from regarding it as the only one. The central features of scientific knowledge are as follows:

Mr President, Mr Dean, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University for the great honour they have bestowed on me in making me a doctor rerum politicarum honoris causa. With Johann Wolfgang Goethe’s great first monologue of Doctor Faust, I can now say:
They call me a master, and a doctor to boot …
But in teaching my students I can do no good.
But I really must ask you for your permission to recite a dozen lines or so from the beginning of the monologue in full; you will find that they are highly relevant.1

On the So-Called Sources of Knowledge
Thank you for the great honour that you have bestowed on me by making me a Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Arts of your University. I am deeply grateful for this honour and I accept it with real pleasure.
I have also taken on a difficult task, at very short notice, namely the task of giving a short lecture. Before I begin this lecture, however, I should like to tell you a true story from my days in New Zealand.
In Christchurch, New Zealand, I was friendly with the physicist Professor Coleridge Farr, who was roughly the same age when I arrived there as I am now. He was a very witty and amusing man and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. Professor Farr was a public-spirited man, and used to give lectures on popular science in the most varied circles, including, among others, prisons. Once he began his lecture in a prison with the words: ‘Today I am giving exactly the same lecture as I gave here six years ago. So if anyone has already heard it, then it jolly well serves him right!’ Scarcely had he uttered these rather provocative words, when the light in the lecture hall went out. He said afterwards that he had felt rather ill at ease until the light came back on.

Science and Criticism
As an old member of the Alpbach Forum I was very pleased to be invited to its thirtieth birthday celebrations; but I only accepted this invitation after some hesitation. I thought it scarcely possible to say something sensible and comprehensible on our extremely wide-ranging basic theme of ‘Intellectual and scientific development over the past thirty years’ in just thirty minutes. In fact, if my mathematics are correct, this leaves me with exactly one minute for each year of intellectual and scientific development! And so I must not fritter away the time available to me with apologies, but must begin without further ado.
I
As you can see from die title I have chosen, ‘Science and Criticism’, I intend to let the question of intellectual development go more or less by the board and to deal mainly with the development of science. The reason for this is, quite simply, that I do not think much of the intellectual or cultural development of die past thirty years.

The Logic of the Social Sciences
I propose to begin my paper on the logic of the social sciences with two theses which express the contrast between our knowledge and our ignorance.
First thesis: We have a fair amount of knowledge. Moreover, we know not only details of doubtful intellectual interest, but also, and more especially, things that are not only of considerable practical importance, but may, in addition, provide us with deep theoretical insight, and with a surprising understanding of the world.
Second thesis: Our ignorance is boundless and sobering. Indeed, it is precisely this overwhelming progress of the natural sciences (to which my first thesis alludes) that continually reminds us of our ignorance, even in the field of the natural sciences themselves.
This gives a new twist to the Socratic idea of ignorance. With each step forward, with every problem we solve, we not only discover new and unsolved problems, but we also discover that just when we believed that we were standing on firm and safe ground, all things are, in reality, insecure and unstable.

Against Big Words
(A Letter not Originally Intended for Publication)
Preface. About fourteen years ago I received a letter from a Herr Klaus Grossner, whom I had never previously heard of. He mentioned my friend Hans Albert and asked me for a written interview about the state of (German) philosophy. I agreed with a great deal of his letter, and although I disagreed with some of it, I nevertheless thought it worthy of discussion; and so I answered his questions in spite of some reservations. In a subsequent letter, Herr Grossner asked me for permission to publish the parts of the letter printed here below in a book he was planning. Despite further misgivings I gave him my permission, but only for his book: I retained all my author’s rights, and stressed that my contribution to his book must not be reprinted without my express permission. Yet shortly afterwards an excerpt appeared (under the excellent title ‘Against Big Words’ [’Wider die groβen Worte’]) in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, without my permission and with no mention of my rights. (In Germany and Austria copyright is often considerably abused.) Since my letter has already been printed twice in excerpts and has been misquoted on many occasions, I have decided to reprint the previously published section here without any amendments, in spite of its aggressiveness. I wrote:

Books and Thoughts
Europe’s First Publication
I am grateful for the invitation to give a lecture about books. This is not only because I think that books, and therefore libraries, are the most characteristic and the most important physical things in our European civilization, and perhaps in human civilization as a whole, but also because of the dominating role books have played – and still play – in my own life. When I was five years old, the first volume of Selma Lagerlöf’s book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (Wunderbare Reise des kleinen Nils Holgersson mit den Wildgdnsen) was read to me. The work had just been published in three green volumes. No other book had such a decisive influence not only on my own character, but also on that of my childhood friend Konrad Lorenz. Konrad fell in love with the wild geese, whilst I fell in love with Selma Lagerlof and her books. Like her I became a school teacher. Both Konrad and I remained true to our loves.

On Culture Clash
I was very pleased to be invited to Vienna to see old friends again and to make new friends; and I felt it as a great honour to be invited here today by the Chairman of the Society of Expatriate Austrians to give a short lecture. His invitation stressed that the subject of my lecture was left to me. So he left to me, very kindly, all the agonies of having to make a choice.
The difficulties in making a decision were considerable. Obviously, I wished to choose a subject that interests me. On the other hand it should also have some relevance to the present occasion – to the meeting of expatriate Austrians in Vienna on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the Austrian State Treaty – the unique event that terminated the occupation of Austria after the Second World War.
I doubt if the subject I have chosen fulfils these expectations. Remembering the Austrian State Treaty and the Russian occupation of Austria that followed the Second World War, my talk is dedicated to the problem of culture clash – a thing that all expatriates must experience.

Immanuel Kant: The Philosopher of the Enlightenment
A Lecture to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Kant’s Death
One hundred and fifty years ago Immanuel Kant died, having spent the eighty years of his life in the Prussian provincial town of Konigsberg. For years his retirement had been complete,1 and his friends intended a quiet burial. But this son of an artisan was buried like a king. When the rumour of his death spread through the town the people flocked to his house demanding to see him. On the day of the funeral the life of the town was at a standstill. The coffin was followed by thousands, while the bells of all the churches were tolling. Nothing like this had ever before happened in Königsberg, say the chroniclers.2

Emancipation through Knowledge
The philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and with it his philosophy of history, is often looked upon in Germany as antiquated, and as superseded by Hegel and his followers. This may well be due to the surpassing intellectual and moral stature of Kant, Germany’s greatest philosopher; for the very greatness of his achievement was a thorn in the flesh of his lesser successors, so that Fichte, and later Hegel, tried to solve this irritating problem by persuading the world that Kant had been merely one of their forerunners. But Kant was nothing of the sort. On the contrary he was a determined opponent of the whole Romantic Movement and especially of Fichte: Kant was in fact the last great exponent of that much reviled movement, the Enlightenment. In an important essay entitled ‘What is Enlightenment?’ (1785) Kant wrote:
Enlightenment is the emancipation of man from a state of self-imposed tutelage. This state is due to his incapacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance. Such a state of tutelage I call ‘self-imposed’ [or ‘culpable’] if it is due not to lack of intelligence but to lack of courage or determination to use one’s own intelligence without the help of a leader. Sapere aude! Dare to use your own intelligence! This is the battle-cry of the Enlightenment.

Public Opinion and Liberal Principles
The following remarks were designed to provide material for debate at an international conference of liberals (in the English sense of the term1). My purpose was simply to lay the foundations for a good general discussion. Because I could assume liberal views in my audience I was largely concerned to challenge, rather than to endorse, popular assumptions favourable to these views.
I. The Myth of Public Opinion
We should beware of a number of myths concerning ‘public opinion’ which are often accepted uncritically.
There is, first, the classical myth, vox populi vox dei, which attributes to the voice of the people a kind of final authority and unlimited wisdom. Its modern equivalent is faith in the ultimate commonsense rightness of that mythical figure, ‘the man in the street’, his vote, and his voice. The avoidance of the plural in both cases is characteristic. Yet people are, thank God, seldom univocal; and the various men in the various streets are as different as any collection of VIPs in a conference-room. And if, on occasion, they do speak more or less in unison, what they say is not necessarily wise. They may be right, or they may be wrong. ‘The voice’ may be very firm on very doubtful issues. (Example: the nearly unanimous and unquestioning acceptance of the demand for ‘unconditional surrender’.) And it may waver on issues over which there is hardly room for doubt. (Example: the question whether to condone political blackmail, and mass-murder.) It may be well-intentioned but imprudent. (Example: the public reaction which destroyed the Hoare–Laval plan.) Or it may be neither well-intentioned nor very prudent. (Example: the approval of the Runciman mission; the approval of the Munich agreement of 1938.)

An Objective Theory of Historical Understanding
The different western philosophies are very largely variations on the theme of body–mind dualism. The main departures from this dualistic theme were attempts to replace it by some kind of monism. It seems to me that these attempts were unsuccessful. We find time and again that behind the veil of monistic protestations there still lurks the dualism of body and mind.
Pluralism and World 3
There were, however, not only monistic deviations, but also some pluralistic ones. This is obvious in polytheism, and even in its monotheistic and atheistic variants. Yet it may seem doubtful whether the various religious interpretations of the world offer an alternative to the dualism of body and mind, for the gods, whether many or few, are either minds endowed with immortal bodies, or else pure minds, in contrast to ourselves.

How I See Philosophy
(Stolen from Fritz Waismann and from One of the First Men to Land on the Moon)
I
A famous and spirited paper by my late friend Friedrich Waismann bears the title ‘How I See Philosophy’.1 There is much in this paper that I admire; and there are a number of points in it with which I can agree, even though my approach is totally different from his.
Fritz Waismann and many of his colleagues take it for granted that philosophers are a special kind of people and that philosophy can be looked upon as their peculiar activity. And what he tries to do in his paper is to show, with the help of examples, what constitutes the distinctive character of a philosopher, and the distinctive character of philosophy, if compared with other academic subjects such as mathematics or physics. Thus he tries, especially, to give a description of the interests and activities of contemporary academic philosophers, and of the sense in which they can be said to carry on what philosophers did in the past.

Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility
(Stolen from Xenophanes and Voltaire)
I have been asked here today to repeat a lecture which I gave in Tubingen, on the theme ‘Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility’. The lecture is dedicated to the memory of Leopold Lucas, a scholar, a historian, a man of toleration and humanity who became a victim of intolerance and inhumanity.
At the age of seventy, in December 1942, Dr Leopold Lucas and his wife were imprisoned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he worked as a rabbi: an immensely difficult task. He died there ten months later. Dora Lucas, his wife, was kept in Theresienstadt for another thirteen months, but she was able to work as a nurse. In October 1944 she was deported to Poland, together with 18,000 other prisoners. There she was put to death.
It was a terrible fate. It was the fate of countless human beings; people who loved other people, who tried to help other people; who were loved by other people and whom other people tried to help. They belonged to families which were torn apart, destroyed, exterminated.

What Does the West Believe in?
(Stolen from the Author of The Open Society)
I am sorry to say that I must begin with an apology: an apology for the title of my lecture. This title reads: ‘What Does the West Believe In?’ When I think of the history of the expression ‘the West’, I wonder whether I should not have avoided it. This expression has gained currency in England primarily through the translation of Spengler’s Untergang des Abendlandes, for the English title of this book is The Decline of the West. Yet I do not, of course, want to associate myself with Spengler, whom I regard not only as a false prophet of an alleged decline, but also as a symptom of a real decline, even though this is not a decline of the West: what his prophecies actually illustrate is the decline of the intellectual conscience of many western thinkers. They illustrate the victory of intellectual immodesty, of the attempt to beguile a public that is thirsty for knowledge by using bombastic words, in short, the victory of Hegelianism and of that Hegelian historicism which Schopenhauer exposed as the intellectual plague of Germany more than a century ago and against which he fought.

Creative Self-Criticism in Science and in Art
(Stolen from Beethoven’s Sketch Books)
I should like first of all to express my thanks for the kind invitation to give the opening address at the Salzburg Festival. This is a great honour. The invitation came as a complete surprise, and it was even somewhat disturbing. Ever since 1950 my wife and I have led a secluded life in our house in the Chiltern Hills. We have no television and no newspaper, and we are completely absorbed by our work. My work is concerned mainly with an abstract subject: the problem of human knowledge and, in particular, of scientific knowledge. That hardly qualifies me to give an opening address at the Salzburg Festival.
So I wondered why I had been invited. First I thought that I had been confused with somebody else. Or was it perhaps because of my love for this city, which sprang from a childhood love, when I was about 5 or 6 years old, well over 70 years ago? Yet no one knew of this. And nobody knew about an adventure I had here on an icy cold night, more than half a century ago. It was midnight, and I was on my way home from skiing, when, in the beautiful light of a full moon, I happened to slip into one of Salzburg’s two famous horseponds … Indeed there must have been other reasons for choosing me as your guest speaker. Then something occurred to me. In one respect I am really quite unique: you see, I am an optimist. I am an optimist in a world where among the intelligentsia it has become a strict rule that one must be a pessimist if one wants to be ‘in’. But I do believe that our age is not so bad as is generally maintained. I do believe that it is better and more beautiful than its reputation. A quarter of a century ago, I gave a lecture, the title of which sounds today even more provocative than it did then: ‘The History of our Time: An Optimist’s View’.1 So if there is anything that qualifies me to give this address, then it is perhaps the reputation of being an incorrigible optimist.
