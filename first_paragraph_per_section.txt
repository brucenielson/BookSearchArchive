Content:
The present book, Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie, can be seen as a collection of drafts and preliminary work from the years 1930 to 1933 for my first published book, Logik der Forschung, the first edition of which appeared in the autumn of 1934. The title is an allusion to Schopenhauer’s Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik 1 (The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics). Earlier preliminary work, as well as some of the work from the years 1930 to 1933, has been lost.
1 Arthur Schopenhauer, Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, behandelt in zwei akademischen Preisschriften: I. Über die Freiheit des menschlichen Willens …, II. Über das Fundament der Moral … (1841; 2nd ed, 1860).
I had not planned on publishing this earlier work. As I have recounted in Section 16 of my autobiography,2 it was Herbert Feigl who in 1929 or 1930 encouraged me to write a book for publication, and who later arranged for me to meet Rudolf Carnap. Carnap read the manuscript of Die beiden Grundprobleme in the summer of 1932, and subsequently several members of the Vienna Circle read it as well. Carnap reported on the manuscript in the journal Erkenntnis,3 and Heinrich Gomperz wrote two detailed letters on it, one to me and one to Oskar Siebeck of the publishing house J.C.B. Mohr, which now, forty-six years later, is publishing the book.

1 In Plato’s Apology of Socrates – perhaps the most beautiful philosophical work I know – Socrates reports how surprised he was that the Delphic Oracle answered “No” to the question of whether anyone was wiser than Socrates. What does the god mean? Socrates asked himself, knowing full well that he was not wise. And he arrived at the following conclusion: “I am indeed a little wiser than the others because I know that I do not know. But the others do not even know that much; for they believe that they know something.”
Socrates’ insight into our ignorance, “I know that I know (almost) nothing”, is of the greatest significance. Often this insight has not been taken very seriously; it has even been held to be paradoxical; and certainly, in the Apology the formulation is intended to sound rather surprising and paradoxical.1
1 “I know that I know nothing” might be considered as a variant of the paradox of the liar (“What I say now is false”). Inserting the word “almost” formally avoids the appearance of the paradox. Therefore “scepticism” (at least in this sense) is certainly not “obviously nonsensical”, as Wittgenstein says (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1918/1922, Proposition 6.51). Also the classic formulation of scepticism, “There is no universal criterion of truth”, is far from being nonsensical: indeed, scepticism in this sense is a true theory. However, one certainly ought not to infer from this that there can be no progress in the sciences.

1. The problem of induction and the problem of demarcation
This analysis focuses on two questions: the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation.
The problem of induction:
We are only able to observe particular events, and always only a limited number of them. Nonetheless, the empirical sciences advance universal propositions, such as the natural laws; that is, propositions which should hold true for an unlimited number of events. What is the justification for advancing such propositions? What is actually meant by these propositions? These questions indicate in outline the problem of induction. The “problem of induction” will denote the question concerning the validity or justification of universal propositions of the empirical sciences. Or, put another way, can empirical propositions that are based on experience be universally valid? (Or more simply, can we know more than we know?)

2. Comments on how the solutions are reached and preliminary presentation of the solutions
Are we justified in calling the problem of induction, but even more so the problem of demarcation, the fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge?
Are we justified in regarding the theory of knowledge as the methodology of the empirical sciences?
Evidently, these questions can only be answered through an analysis that takes into account the historical circumstances. However, such analysis need not, as a consequence, have a historical interest. It will only have to show that the typical problems that have, time and again, been dealt with by the theory of knowledge, are reducible to the problem of induction and then to the problem of demarcation; and it will also have to show that these problems may be viewed as methodological problems, and that such a view is a productive one.

5. The infinite regression (Hume's argument)
Hume1 was the first who presented, with exemplary clarity, the difficulties surrounding the problem of universal empirical statements, or the problem of induction (“Can we know more than we know?”). He demonstrated that every attempt at inductive generalisation will be defeated by a circular inference.
1 [David Hume, A Treatise on Human Nature (1739/1740), Book I, Part III, Section VI. Ed.]
This argument will be presented here in detail: it is the crucial idea of the whole problem area. The presentation will deviate from Hume on some points of only minor relevance to the subject. (In particular, Hume’s circular inference will be replaced by a so-called regressus in infinitum.*1) This does not, however, alter Hume’s fundamental idea that in analysing any inductive generalisation, one will necessarily encounter impermissible logical operations.

7. The normal-statement positions: naive inductivism, strict positivism and apriorism
The normal-statement positions on inductivism assume that all empirical statements are “normal” statements, that is, that they are decidably true or false.*1 It “is essential for a genuine statement”, says Schlick,1 “that it be in principle finally verifiable or falsifiable”. If “strict universal empirical statements” exist at all, then the same will also apply to them.
*1 What is meant is: “normal” statements have a logical form such that, if they are true, their truth is decidable, and if they are false, their falsity is decidable; that is, decidable by experience.

11. Supplement to the critique of apriorism
(Psychologism and transcendentalism in Kant and Fries. – On the question of the empirical basis.) The present rather lengthy section ought, strictly speaking, to be characterised as a digression. While in this part of the book there is otherwise no digression from the analysis of the problem of induction, this section will present a number of related problems in some detail. It will not, however, change the position we have already reached in discussing the problem of induction. The next section will therefore resume the argument from the end of the preceding section.
Thus, the analysis in this section is intended not to move the discussion forward but rather to deepen it, particularly with respect to the question of the epistemological method. Although, in a certain sense, this section represents merely a collection of critical reflections, nevertheless it serves the important purpose of showing that a systematic comparison of the transcendental and the psychological methods is an illuminating and promising way of getting closer to the solution of epistemological problems.

12. The probability positions – subjective belief in probability
The normal-statement positions cannot be satisfactory:
Naive inductivism is logically untenable; it is directly refuted by Hume’s argument.
Strict positivism is logically consistent, but epistemologically (transcendentally) unsatisfactory. It does not provide an explanation for the existence of natural laws, and cannot give an adequate interpretation of theoretical natural science. It offers too little.
Apriorism, on the other hand, offers too much. It “proves” the absolute a priori validity of certain empirical statements; but empirical science will find it hard to accept the view that there are empirical statements that are necessarily valid and in principle irrefutable by experience.
This is where the probability positions enter, which seem to overcome all of these difficulties. They agree with positivism (and empirical science) that universal empirical statements can never be ultimately verified; like apriorism (and again like empirical science) they acknowledge that natural laws are strictly universal empirical statements.

18. The pseudo-statement positions: new formulation of the problem
The preceding considerations allow us to make a generalisation that is decisive for the problem situation.
If a statement is not to be regarded as valid, then this must be expressed by a statement about that statement; regardless of whether that statement is to be called “false” or perhaps “probable”, or whether we wish to assign to it any other truth value whatsoever (except for the value “true”).
Only if this second statement, or some other higher-order statement, can be unconditionally true will the regression stop. However, should none of these statements be considered unconditionally true, then the infinite regression will be inevitable. Putting all these statements together, we have in effect said nothing.
As a result, we no longer have any reason to add another truth value to “two-valued logic”. (In principle, singular empirical statements must always be definitively verifiable or falsifiable; and such a step can be of no benefit to universal empirical statements.)

24. The pseudo-statement positions will temporarily be put away: conventionalism
Conventionalism regards natural laws as genuine statements. Therefore, it is not a pseudo-statement position.
In contrast to all previously discussed views, conventionalism is deductivist: this is one reason why it is of interest. Discussing it does not, however, properly belong to a critical analysis of the inductivist positions.
Conventionalism is distinguished from the deductivist and empiricist theory of knowledge (which I advocate) above all by the fact that it must be characterised as non-empiricist. According to the conventionalist view, experience cannot decide the truth or falsity of natural laws. According to conventionalism, natural laws are analytic judgements because they are (hidden) definitions, arbitrary stipulations, “conventions”.

31. Implication and general implication
Our critical discussion of the pseudo-statement positions was interrupted in order to enable us to analyse (in sections 24–30) the set of problems posed by conventionalism, above all in order to allow a closer characterisation of the first pseudo-statement position.
On that occasion, logical (logistical) questions were discussed in perhaps greater detail than was absolutely necessary. This was done in part because a polemical treatment was desirable, but also because the terminological machinery acquired in that process will be needed in a further discussion, which is also polemical. Only after concluding this discussion can we return to the critique of the pseudo-statement positions.
This second polemic concerns the relationship between general implications on the one hand and universal and singular statements on the other.

36. Return to the discussion of the pseudo-statement positions
A brief recapitulation, from the start of our discussion of the pseudo-statement positions, should serve to recall the course of our analysis so far.
The pseudo-statement positions deny natural laws the character of genuine propositions to which truth values can be assigned. If this position were accepted, the problem of induction, or the question of the validity of natural laws, would disappear. It would be not a genuine problem, but only a pseudo-problem caused by the misunderstanding by which natural laws are regarded as genuine statements.
This idea – which we owe to Wittgenstein and Schlick – leads to the question being posed in a new form: What are natural laws if they are not genuine propositions?
The answer1 that natural laws are “rules for the transformation of statements” was accepted here tentatively, but it was not considered satisfactory. For such rules might also be genuine propositions. To the new formulation of the question had to be added the demand that natural laws be so defined that their character as pseudo-statements is put beyond doubt.

43. The concept of meaning in logical positivism
In the writings of logical positivists, the concept of meaning is of paramount significance. There can be no doubt that Wittgenstein’s and Schlick’s pseudo-statement positions can be understood only in connection with the concept of meaning, which is why this concept will be presented here in detail. (To the extent that the structure of my presentation permits it, I shall use quotations.)
Before one can even ask about a proposition being true or false, one must know whether it has a meaning or whether it is nonsensical. The (putative) proposition “Socrates is identical” is nonsensical; and it would also be nonsensical to ask whether it is true or false.
It is one of Wittgenstein’s fundamental ideas that the grammatically correct form of a proposition offers no guarantee that it is meaningful.

47. The dialectical and the transcendental corroboration of the solution
The critique of inductivist attempts to solve the problem of induction has been concluded. What has it achieved?
Even the sharpest polemic in this investigation was designed, first and foremost, to serve a positive purpose. But what is this purpose, and how should it be assessed?
I see the primary value of the critical-polemical form in being an acid test of the positive solution. We should not, of course, overrate this form of testing. Its sole value consists, essentially, in making the proposed solution fit for discussion.
One might also call this critical-polemical test a dialectical corroboration of the solution, because (to characterise this method in the words of H. Gomperz 1) it “lets every attempted solution … emerge from the contradictions that another attempt has encountered, either with its own assumptions or with concepts of the individual sciences or of scientific practice”, and because it seeks to show that the proposed solution “contains within itself, in ‘preserved’ form, the justified elements of earlier attempted resolutions”.

Is there a philosophical science? (Introductory considerations on the problem of demarcation.)
An investigation in an individual science, say in physics, can begin straight away with the formulation of the problem. It is possible “to enter the house through open doors”, as it were; for a “house” exists: a structure of scientific theory, a generally recognised problem situation. The researcher can count on the reader (who can be expected to be familiar with the discipline’s prerequisites) to fit the new work into the overall context of scientific knowledge.
A philosopher finds himself in an entirely different situation. He faces not a theoretical edifice but a heap of ruins. He cannot take as his starting point a generally recognised problem situation; for the only thing that is generally recognised is, most often, that there is none. Indeed, it is even fashionable in philosophical circles to assert that nothing like a genuine philosophical problem can exist at all.

1. The problem of demarcation
What distinguishes the empirical sciences from the non-empirical sciences and from extra-scientific domains?
Is there a criterion that demarcates the empirical sciences from non-empirical domains? A criterion that marks out some statements or systems of statements as empirical, and others as non-empirical?
I call the question about such a demarcation criterion the “demarcation problem”.
The demarcation problem is the fundamental problem of the theory of knowledge: all epistemological questions can be reduced to it.
2. Scope of the problem of demarcation
Instead of the question:
What is knowledge?
(which, in this form, can surely lead to little but a fruitless quarrel about nominal definitions, for definitions are always arbitrary), we could start by asking the narrower question:

Section Title: II. ON THE QUESTION OF ELIMINATING SUBJECTIVIST PSYCHOLOGISM - ch14
Content:
DOI: 10.4324/9780203371107-17
The deductivist, transcendentalist and objectivist view of science advocated here, differs in a truly fundamental way from any inductivist, psychologistic and subjectivist view of science such as the one advocated by (for example) modern positivism. Inductivism (positivism) regards our perceptions (and perhaps other experiences also) as the foundation of all knowledge, of all science. This basic theme is common to all positivist approaches, although they interpret it in a variety of different ways. Some go so far as to regard scientific statements as being “only” logical constructions of experiences; others regard the concepts of empirical science as “only” logical constructions (classes of classes, classes of relations) of elementary experiences. The transcendental untenability of this view, and the logical difficulty of treating irrational elements (which is what our experiences are) logically and rationally, lead positivism ultimately (while not abandoning its basic position) to replace irrational experiences with rational constructs, namely with perceptual statements (“protocol sentences”). The foundations of science are to be constituted no longer by our irrational perceptions, but by the rationalised linguistic expression of these perceptions.

1. An objection to the criterion of falsifiability
The following objection can be raised, and quite rightly so, to the proposed solutions to the demarcation problem2 and to the problem of induction:
2 [See Editor’s Postscript. Ed.]
Admittedly, so this objection may be formulated, scientific theories represent non-verifiable systems; they are not, however, unverifiable only, but unfalsifiable also. Every theoretical system can be protected against empirical falsification, and in a variety of ways. One can introduce auxiliary hypotheses to “explain” the observations that threaten the theoretical system, that is, to bring them into agreement with the system; or one can amend the “coordinative definitions” (or whatever takes their place if not working with “coordinative definitions”, as in the view advocated here). In other words, one can alter the empirical meaning assigned to the concepts ([or] the terms) that occur in the theory. Finally, one can simply exclude the unfavourable observations by declaring them to be “fabricated”, “unscientific”, “non-objective” or something of this sort. Any one of these procedures, and even more so in combination, makes it possible to protect a theory against falsification. The reference to the one-sided falsifiability of theories, therefore, is not a sound argument and is incapable of paving the way for a solution of the epistemological problems. There is, moreover, no asymmetry between positive and negative truth values, between verification and falsification. The proposed solution to the problem of induction should be rejected, because natural laws are not “partially decidable” but not decidable at all. The proposed solution to the demarcation problem should be rejected because scientific theories are not falsifiable, which entails that falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation would exclude them from science (as a result of which, the arguments raised against Wittgenstein’s criterion of meaning3 would now be turned against the position advocated here).

The term “method of exhaustion” was coined by Dingler.2 He is probably unique among modern methodologists in forcefully emphasising that we address reality with our theoretical questions, and “exhaust” it with the help of our theories. We capture only those things that find space in our receptacle (the theory).

Principle of falsifiability
Empirical scientific statements or systems of statements are distinguished by being empirically falsifiable.
Singular empirical statements can be empirically verifiable also; theoretical systems, natural laws and universal empirical statements are, in principle, one-sidedly falsifiable only.
The theory of method explains in further detail what is to be understood by “empirical falsification” and “empirical verification”. It explains also the conditions (the “methodological decisions”) designed to ensure the empirical falsifiability of empirical statements and systems of statements.
1. Principle of continuity
So long as any system of hypotheses is to be regarded as not falsified, the application of the following rules notwithstanding, it is regarded as corroborated. The rule is: all admissible means of escaping falsification should be used.

Content:
The situation in contemporary philosophy is characterised by the opposition between the proponents of “metaphysics” and those of “anti-metaphysics”.
The question at the centre of this controversy is the one about the relationship between philosophy and the empirical sciences.
The metaphysician is quite wary of empirical science. Recent upheavals in the natural sciences in particular, having rocked the very foundations of their systems, strike him as an alarming symptom of an internal crisis, as a consequence of the alienation of empirical research from its philosophical basis; for only philosophy can provide the ultimate justification of empirical science.
The anti-metaphysician admires the rapid developments in modern natural science. It appears to him that the more profoundly these developments rock its foundations, the more powerful its empirical, non-philosophical character will become. Empirical science seems to be freeing itself from the inhibiting prejudices of its metaphysical past. In the attitude of metaphysics towards modern natural science, the anti-metaphysician can see only uncomprehending presumptuousness. Empirical science is autonomous. It needs no philosophy to provide it with any “foundations”. There is no longer any need for a philosophical science superordinate to the individual sciences. The supposed problems of philosophy prove to be meaningless or even nonsensical pseudo-problems. Much like Kant1 (“philosophy can never be learned … we can at most learn to philosophise”), although more radically, the anti-metaphysician declares that philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity.2

[Introduction.]
Is there a philosophical science? Are there, beside the empirical sciences, beside logic and mathematics, other sciences that have a specific, a “philosophical” character?
I believe that to pose the question is to answer it. By speaking about empirical science, about logic and mathematics, about the relationships between these sciences, by asking whether there is a “science”, we have already constituted a system of concepts that belong to a domain we should probably have to identify as “philosophy”. The concept “empirical science” is not a concept of empirical science. The concept “logic” is not a concept of logic. The concept “mathematics” is not a concept of mathematics. All these concepts belong to a theory of science.
It would seem obvious, furthermore, that the concept of a “theory of science” cannot be a concept of the theory of science. And this is quite true. We arrive at a kind of hierarchy of analytical types, each one investigating the nature of the type subordinate to it.*1 But this does not create a problem: we are not facing an infinite regression, for the truth of the statements that belong to the subordinate science is not deduced from that of the superordinate one. Each of these sciences has to fend for itself. (Compare Nelson’s critique.1>)

1. Methodology and the possibility of falsification
We began by examining theoretical statements, in order to see whether by virtue of their logical form they permit strict verification through singular statements. This has proved not to be the case. Instead of trying, as it were, to circumvent this negative result and replace a strict form of verification with a more relaxed form, which would have entangled us in the difficulties of the problem of induction, we abandoned the idea of verification in any form and turned to falsification. It seems to us that falsification attempts offer the only possibility of testing a theory empirically.
We had to turn to a logical investigation of the falsifiability of a theory. We were able to develop falsifiability as a relationship between a theory and its possible empirical basic statements. This shifted the question logically to the problem of basic statements.

[1. Introduction.]
The supposed problem of free will emerges with full force within a “deterministic” world view only, that is, where physics (to put it a little simplistically) draws a picture of the world that resembles the movement of a clock. Modern quantum physics, with its “non-deterministic” probability statements, seems more likely to blur the problem of free will than to solve it. More precisely, this blurring of the problem is caused not by physics itself, of course, but by impermissible interpretations.
I believe that we shall gain a much clearer understanding of the question of free will, if we stand back completely from contemporary physics and ask ourselves how the problem would appear if we imagined a completely deterministic physics.
Let us pose the problem as specifically as possible, if only in an “ad hominem” fashion. If, as a consequence of a deterministic world view, we regarded the creations of Bach or of Michelangelo, for example, as nothing but the outcomes of necessary physical processes, the products of an automatic physical apparatus, something in us would rebel against accepting such a consequence. If we imagined all the physical processes in the world as determined by the constellation of initial conditions and natural laws, then whether we liked it or not we would have to assume that the works of Bach and of Michelangelo were contained in them already in nuce, that is, we would find ourselves almost irretrievably within a metaphysics of pre-established harmony.

5. Individuals and universals
Even though we can never provide anything approaching a complete description of a “slice of reality”, we can always give it a name; we can characterise it in individual terms. Here, once again, we encounter the problem of universals. We have established already2 that it is impossible to replace an individual concept, or to identify an individual unambiguously, by any number of universals. We encounter the same opposition in the relationship between “event” and “slice of reality”; for if we could describe a “slice of reality” unambiguously, we could replace its name by a description.

[Introduction.]
Only from the vantage point of the frequency interpretation1 of probability statements is it possible to formulate precisely the distinctive paradox inherent in all probability arguments, a paradox that constitutes the one aspect of probability that is most in need of an epistemological clarification.
1 [See Karl Popper, Logik der Forschung (1934), Chapter VI (2nd ed., 1966, Chapter VIII) [The Logic of Scientific Discover (1959; 2nd ed., 1968), Chapter VIII. Tr.]. Ed.]
This paradox consists in the following: there are particular classes of events to which we tend to apply a very characteristic and perplexing form of expression. When it becomes apparent, for particular series of events*1 that belong to such a class, that we are unable to come up with predictions for the individual events in these series, from this impossibility of predicting an individual event we infer the possibility of making a prediction for the whole series; that is, a frequency prediction.

1. Introduction
This edition of The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge contains everything that could be found2 of the original copies of the manuscript. Despite tireless efforts3 to track down the missing parts, it has proved impossible to publish a complete edition of this two-volume work, written in the years 1930–1933. Volume I: The Problem of Induction appears to have been preserved in its entirety,4 whereas almost the whole manuscript of Volume II: The Problem of Demarcation must be presumed lost. Of this volume, there exist a few fragments only and the drastically abridged version published in 1934 under the title Logik der Forschung.5 This book and two short papers (1933–1935) on induction and demarcation in the journal Erkenntnis 6 are all that has been published to date (January 1979) of The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge.7
