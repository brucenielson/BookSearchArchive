AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1993
I do not regard myself as an expert in either science or philosophy. I have, however, tried hard all my life to understand something of the world we live in. Scientific knowledge, and the human rationality that produces it, are, I believe, always fallible, or subject to error. But they are, I believe, also the pride of mankind. For man is, so far as I know, the only thing in the universe that tries to understand what it is all about. May we continue to do so, and may we also be aware of the severe limitations of all our contributions.
For many years I have argued against intellectual fashions in the sciences, and even more against intellectual fashions in philosophy. The fashionable thinker is, in the main, a prisoner of his fashion, and I regard freedom, political freedom as well as a free and open mind, as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, value that our life can offer us.

INTRODUCTION
All, or almost all, the papers collected in this volume are written to defend rationality and rational criticism. It is a way of thinking, and even a way of living: a readiness to listen to critical arguments, to search for one’s own mistakes, and to learn from them. It is, fundamentally, an attitude that I have tried to formulate (perhaps first in 1932) in the following two lines:
‘I may be wrong and you may be right,
and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.’
These two lines in italics here quoted were first printed in 1945 in my Open Society (volume II, the second page of chapter 24, ‘The Revolt Against Reason’); and I italicized the lines in order to indicate that I regarded them as important. For these two lines were an attempt to summarize a very central part of my moral articles of faith. The view that they summed up I called ‘critical rationalism’.

THE RATIONALITY OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS
Selection versus instruction
The title of this series of Spencer lectures, ‘Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences’, was chosen by the organizers of the series. The title seems to imply that progress in science is a good thing, and that an obstacle to progress is a bad thing – a position held by almost everybody until quite recently. Perhaps I should make it clear at once that I accept this position, although with some slight and faintly obvious reservations to which I shall briefly allude later. Of course, obstacles which are due to the inherent difficulty of the problems tackled are welcome challenges. (Indeed, many scientists were greatly disappointed when it turned out that the problem of tapping nuclear energy was comparatively trivial, involving no new revolutionary change of theory.) But stagnation in science would be a curse. Still, I agree with Professor Bodmer’s suggestion that scientific advance is only a mixed blessing1. Let’s face it: blessings are mixed, though there may be some exceedingly rare exceptions.

THE MYTH OF THE FRAMEWORK
Those who believe this, and those who do not, have no common ground of discussion, but in view of their opinions they must of necessity scorn each other.

REASON OR REVOLUTION?
The trouble with a total revolution …
Is that it brings the same class up on top.
Executives of skilful execution
Will therefore plan to go halfway and stop.
Robert Frost
The following critical considerations are reactions to the book, Der Positivismusstreit in der deutschen Soziologie,1 which was published in 1969, and for which I unwittingly provided the original incentive.

PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS
The influence on theoretical and experimental physics of some metaphysical speculations on the structure of matter
The following remarks are intended as an illustration of the important thesis that science is capable of solving philosophical problems and that modern science, at any rate, has something important to say to the philosopher about some of the classical problems of philosophy – especially about the old problem of matter. I intend to discuss certain aspects of the problem of matter since Descartes. And I intend to point out the interesting fact that some of these problems were solved, in collaboration, by speculative philosophers, such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant, who all helped by proposing important though tentative solutions and thus prepared the way for the work of experimental scientists and theorists of physics such as Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, de Broglie, and Schrödinger.

THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCIENTIST
The topic I am going to discuss was not of my choosing, but was suggested by the organizers of this conference. I say this because I do not think that I can make any significant contribution to the solution of the grave problems involved. I nevertheless accepted the invitation to speak about it because I believe that in this respect we are all more or less in the same boat. I take it that our topic, ‘the moral responsibility of the scientist’, is a kind of euphemism for the issue of nuclear and biological warfare. But I shall try to approach our topic with some wider issues in mind.
One may say that the problem has lately become more general, due to the fact that lately all science, and indeed all learning, has tended to become potentially applicable. Formerly, the pure scientist or the pure scholar had only one responsibility beyond those which everyone else has – that is, to search for truth. He had to further the growth of his subject as well as he could. For all I know, Maxwell had little reason to worry about the possible applications of his equations. And perhaps even Hertz did not worry about Hertzian waves. This happy situation belongs to the past. Today not only all pure science may become applied science, but even all pure scholarship.

MODELS, INSTRUMENTS, AND TRUTH
The status of the rationality principle in the social sciences
When I received the invitation to present to you my views on the methodology of the social sciences, I felt very honoured indeed. But I also felt a little uneasy, for the following reasons. My views on the methodology of the social sciences are the result of my admiration for economic theory: I began to develop them, some twenty-five years ago, by trying to generalize the method of theoretical economics.1 You will understand my fear that you may, as economists, find my views trivial – if not altogether out of date.
It was this fear that made me decide to devote about one-third of this lecture to my views on the methodology of science in general, one third (sections 2 to 7) to problems peculiar to the methods of social science, and the remainder (sections 8 to 11) to an attack upon the instrumentalist philosophy of science – that still fashionable philosophical theory of pragmatism which tells us that our theories are nothing but instruments. To this I shall oppose my own view according to which theories are steps in our search for truth – or to be both more explicit and more modest, in our search for better and better solutions of deeper and deeper problems (where ‘better and better’ means, as we shall see, ‘nearer and nearer to the truth’).2

EPISTEMOLOGY AND INDUSTRIALIZATION
Francis Bacon looked forward to an alteration in the form of production and to the effective control of nature by man, as a result of a change in the ways of thinking.
