AUTHOR’S NOTE, 1993
I do not regard myself as an expert in either science or philosophy. I have, however, tried hard all my life to understand something of the world we live in. Scientific knowledge, and the human rationality that produces it, are, I believe, always fallible, or subject to error. But they are, I believe, also the pride of mankind. For man is, so far as I know, the only thing in the universe that tries to understand what it is all about. May we continue to do so, and may we also be aware of the severe limitations of all our contributions.
For many years I have argued against intellectual fashions in the sciences, and even more against intellectual fashions in philosophy. The fashionable thinker is, in the main, a prisoner of his fashion, and I regard freedom, political freedom as well as a free and open mind, as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, value that our life can offer us.

INTRODUCTION
All, or almost all, the papers collected in this volume are written to defend rationality and rational criticism. It is a way of thinking, and even a way of living: a readiness to listen to critical arguments, to search for one’s own mistakes, and to learn from them. It is, fundamentally, an attitude that I have tried to formulate (perhaps first in 1932) in the following two lines:
‘I may be wrong and you may be right,
and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.’
These two lines in italics here quoted were first printed in 1945 in my Open Society (volume II, the second page of chapter 24, ‘The Revolt Against Reason’); and I italicized the lines in order to indicate that I regarded them as important. For these two lines were an attempt to summarize a very central part of my moral articles of faith. The view that they summed up I called ‘critical rationalism’.

THE RATIONALITY OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS
Selection versus instruction
The title of this series of Spencer lectures, ‘Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences’, was chosen by the organizers of the series. The title seems to imply that progress in science is a good thing, and that an obstacle to progress is a bad thing – a position held by almost everybody until quite recently. Perhaps I should make it clear at once that I accept this position, although with some slight and faintly obvious reservations to which I shall briefly allude later. Of course, obstacles which are due to the inherent difficulty of the problems tackled are welcome challenges. (Indeed, many scientists were greatly disappointed when it turned out that the problem of tapping nuclear energy was comparatively trivial, involving no new revolutionary change of theory.) But stagnation in science would be a curse. Still, I agree with Professor Bodmer’s suggestion that scientific advance is only a mixed blessing1. Let’s face it: blessings are mixed, though there may be some exceedingly rare exceptions.

THE MYTH OF THE FRAMEWORK
Those who believe this, and those who do not, have no common ground of discussion, but in view of their opinions they must of necessity scorn each other.
Plato
I
One of the more disturbing aspects of the intellectual life of our time is the way in which irrationalism is so widely advocated, and the way in which irrationalist doctrines are taken for granted. One of the components of modern irrationalism is relativism (the doctrine that truth is relative to our intellectual background, which is supposed to determine somehow the framework within which we are able to think: that truth may change from one framework to another), and, in particular, the doctrine of the impossibility of mutual understanding between different cultures, generations, or historical periods – even within science, even within physics. In this paper I discuss the problem of relativism. It is my claim that behind it lies what I call ‘The Myth of the Framework’. I explain and criticize this myth, and comment also on arguments that have been used in its defence.

REASON OR REVOLUTION?
The trouble with a total revolution …
Is that it brings the same class up on top.
Executives of skilful execution
Will therefore plan to go halfway and stop.
Robert Frost
The following critical considerations are reactions to the book, Der Positivismusstreit in der deutschen Soziologie,1 which was published in 1969, and for which I unwittingly provided the original incentive.
I
I will begin by telling some of the history of the book and of its misleading title. In 1960 I was invited to open a discussion on ‘The Logic of the Social Sciences’ at a congress of German sociologists in Tübingen. I accepted – and I was told that my opening address would be followed by a reply from Professor Theodor W. Adorno of Frankfurt. It was suggested to me by the organizers that, in order to make a fruitful discussion possible, I should formulate my views in a number of definite theses. This I did: my opening address to that discussion, delivered in 1961, consisted of twenty-seven sharply formulated theses, plus a programmatic formulation of the task of the theoretical social sciences. Of course, I formulated these theses so as to make it difficult for any Hegelian or Marxist (such as Adorno) to accept them. And I supported them as well as I could by arguments. Owing to the limited time available, I confined myself to fundamentals, and I tried to avoid repeating what I had said elsewhere.

SCIENCE: PROBLEMS, AIMS, RESPONSIBILITIES
I
The intellectual history of man has its depressing as well as its exhilarating aspects. For one may well look upon it as a history of prejudice and dogma, tenaciously held, and often combined with intolerance and fanaticism. One may even describe it as a history of spells of religious or quasi-religious frenzy. It should be remembered, in this context, that most of our great destructive wars have been religious or ideological wars – with the notable exception, perhaps, of the wars of Genghis Khan, who seems to have been a model of religious toleration.
Yet even the sad and depressing picture of religious wars has its brighter side. It is an encouraging fact that countless men, from ancient to modern times, have been ready to live and to die for their convictions, for ideas – ideas which they believed to be true.

PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS
The influence on theoretical and experimental physics of some metaphysical speculations on the structure of matter
The following remarks are intended as an illustration of the important thesis that science is capable of solving philosophical problems and that modern science, at any rate, has something important to say to the philosopher about some of the classical problems of philosophy – especially about the old problem of matter. I intend to discuss certain aspects of the problem of matter since Descartes. And I intend to point out the interesting fact that some of these problems were solved, in collaboration, by speculative philosophers, such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant, who all helped by proposing important though tentative solutions and thus prepared the way for the work of experimental scientists and theorists of physics such as Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, de Broglie, and Schrödinger.

THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCIENTIST
The topic I am going to discuss was not of my choosing, but was suggested by the organizers of this conference. I say this because I do not think that I can make any significant contribution to the solution of the grave problems involved. I nevertheless accepted the invitation to speak about it because I believe that in this respect we are all more or less in the same boat. I take it that our topic, ‘the moral responsibility of the scientist’, is a kind of euphemism for the issue of nuclear and biological warfare. But I shall try to approach our topic with some wider issues in mind.
One may say that the problem has lately become more general, due to the fact that lately all science, and indeed all learning, has tended to become potentially applicable. Formerly, the pure scientist or the pure scholar had only one responsibility beyond those which everyone else has – that is, to search for truth. He had to further the growth of his subject as well as he could. For all I know, Maxwell had little reason to worry about the possible applications of his equations. And perhaps even Hertz did not worry about Hertzian waves. This happy situation belongs to the past. Today not only all pure science may become applied science, but even all pure scholarship.

A PLURALIST APPROACH TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
I
What may be called the philosophy of history persistently turns round three big questions.
1 Is there a plot to history, and if so, what is it?
2 What is the use of history?
3 How are we to write history, or what is the method of history?
(This also includes the ‘problem of historical knowledge’.)
Answers to these three questions have been given, implicitly and explicitly, from the Bible and Homer down to our own day. And the answers have changed astonishingly little.
The oldest answer to our first question, given in the Bible and in Homer, is theistic. There is a plot to history. But it is only dimly discernible, because it results from the will of God, or of the gods. And though it is perhaps not completely unfathomable, it is not easy to fathom. At any rate, there is something secret hidden behind the surface of events. It has to do with reward and punishment, with a kind of divine balance of justice – though only by the most discerning can justice be seen to be done.

MODELS, INSTRUMENTS, AND TRUTH
The status of the rationality principle in the social sciences
When I received the invitation to present to you my views on the methodology of the social sciences, I felt very honoured indeed. But I also felt a little uneasy, for the following reasons. My views on the methodology of the social sciences are the result of my admiration for economic theory: I began to develop them, some twenty-five years ago, by trying to generalize the method of theoretical economics.1 You will understand my fear that you may, as economists, find my views trivial – if not altogether out of date.
It was this fear that made me decide to devote about one-third of this lecture to my views on the methodology of science in general, one third (sections 2 to 7) to problems peculiar to the methods of social science, and the remainder (sections 8 to 11) to an attack upon the instrumentalist philosophy of science – that still fashionable philosophical theory of pragmatism which tells us that our theories are nothing but instruments. To this I shall oppose my own view according to which theories are steps in our search for truth – or to be both more explicit and more modest, in our search for better and better solutions of deeper and deeper problems (where ‘better and better’ means, as we shall see, ‘nearer and nearer to the truth’).2

EPISTEMOLOGY AND INDUSTRIALIZATION
Francis Bacon looked forward to an alteration in the form of production and to the effective control of nature by man, as a result of a change in the ways of thinking.
Karl Marx
I
In a famous and highly dramatic passage of his chief work, Plato demands that philosophers should be kings and, vice versa, that kings – or autocratic rulers – should be fully trained philosophers.1 Plato’s proposal that philosophers should be kings has pleased many philosophers, and some of them have taken it quite seriously. Personally I do not find it an attractive proposal. Quite apart from the fact that I am against any form of autocracy or dictatorship, including the dictatorship of the wisest and best, philosophers do not seem to me particularly well suited for the job. Take for example the case of Thomas Masaryk, the creator, first president and, one might say, the philosopher-king of the Czechoslovak Republic. Masaryk was not only a fully trained philosopher, but also a born statesman and a great and admirable man. And his creation, the Czechoslovak Republic, was an unparalleled political achievement. Yet the dissolution of the Old Austrian Empire was also partly Masaryk’s work. And this proved a disaster for Europe and the world. For the instability that followed this dissolution was largely responsible for the rise of Nazism and finally even for the downfall of Masaryk’s own Czechoslovak Republic. And it is significant that Masaryk’s doctrine that ‘Austria-Hungary, this antinational … state, must be dismembered’2 (to use his own words) was derived from a mistaken philosophical doctrine: from the philosophical principle of the National State.3 But this principle, the principle of political nationalism, is not only an unfortunate and even a mischievous conception, it is also one that is actually impossible to realize. This is because Nations – in the sense of those who advocate this principle – do not exist: they are theoretical constructs, and the theories in which they are constructed are wholly inadequate, and completely inapplicable to Europe. For the political theory of nationalism rests on the assumption that there are ethnic groups which at the same time are also linguistic groups, and which happen also to inhabit geographically unified and coherent regions with natural boundaries that are defensible from a military point of view – groups which are united by a common language, a common territory, a common history, a common culture, and a common fate. The boundaries of the regions inhabited by these groups should, according to the theory of the Nation State, form boundaries of the new national states.
