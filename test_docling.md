## A WORLD OF PROPENSITIES Karl R. Popper

The two lectures presented here belong to Popper's late work, most of which is still unpublished. The first introduces a new view of causality, based on Popper's interpretation of quantum theory yet freed of all difficulty. It is a new and encouraging view of the universe. a view that easily merges with the commonsense view that our will is free. The second lecture gives a glimpse of human knowledge as it evolves from animal knowledge.

## /tom the PREFACE

I am of course not certain whether the two lectures which I here submit to the patient perusal or the possible refusal of my readers are, as I hope, the best I have produced so far, nor is this question, I admit, of any importance. But I wish to convey to my readers that I have worked hard to make them the best, since I myself have, in writing them, been able to learn things of great importance to myself.
